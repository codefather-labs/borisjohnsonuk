Foreword “A programming language created by a community fosters happiness in its users around the world.” — Guido van Rossum,  King’s Day Speech 2016 I love building tools that help us learn, empower us to create, and move us to share knowledge and ideas with others. I feel humbled, thankful, and proud when I hear how these tools and Python are helping you to solve real-world problems, like climate change or Alzheimer’s. Through my “four decades” love of programming and problem solving, I have spent time learning, writing a lot of code, and sharing my ideas with others. I’ve seen profound changes in technology as the world progressed from mainframes to cell phone service to the wide-ranging wonders of the web and cloud computing. All of these technologies, including Python, have one thing in common. At one moment, these successful innovations were nothing more than an idea. The creators, like Guido, had to take risks and leaps of faith to move forward. Dedication, learning through trial and error and working through many failures together built a solid foundation for success and growth. CPython Internals  will take you on a journey to explore the wildly successful language,  Python . The book serves as a guidebook for learning how CPython is created under the hood. It will give you a glimpse of how the core developers crafted the language. Python’s strengths 13
