Multi-Process Parallelism preter process has a signiﬁcation overhead, the  Pool  will consider each process in the pool a “worker.” If a worker has completed, it will be reused. If you replace the line: with  mp.Pool( 4 )  as  pool: with: with  mp.Pool( 4 , maxtasksperchild = 1 )  as  pool: Thie previous multiprocessing examle will print something similar to: $ python pool_process_celcius.py 110F is 43.333333333333336C (pid 5654) 120F is 48.88888888888889C (pid 5653) 130F is 54.44444444444445C (pid 5652) 140F is 60.0C (pid 5655) The output shows the process IDs of the newly spawned processes and the calculated values. Creation of Child Processes Both of these scripts will create a new Python interpreter process and pass data to it using  pickle . See Also The  pickle  module is a serialization package used for serializing Python objects. Davide Mastromatteo has written a great write up of the  pickle module at realpython.com . For POSIX systems, the creation of the subprocess by the multiprocessing  module is equivalent to this command: $ python -c 'from multiprocessing.spawn import spawn_main; spawn_main(tracker_fd=<i>, pipe_handle=<j>)' --multiprocessing-fork Where  <i>  is the ﬁlehandle descriptor, and  <j>  is the pipe handle de- 237
