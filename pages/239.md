Multi-Process Parallelism '/Users/anthonyshaw' , ]} The second object written is the  BaseProcess  child class instance. Depending on how multiprocessing was called and which Operating System is being used, one of the child classes of  BaseProcess  will be the instance serialized. Both the preparation data and process object are serialized using the pickle  module and written to the parent processâ€™ pipe stream: Parent Process Worker Pool Worker 0 Worker 1 Pipe 010101010100011100 (Waiting) (Not Created) pickle write() Preparation Data Process Object Note The POSIX implementation of the child process spawning and serialization process is located in  Lib multiprocessing popen_- spawn_posix.py . The Windows implementation is located in  Lib multiprocessing popen_spawn_win32.py . Executing the Child Process The entry point of the child process,  multiprocessing.spawn.spawn_- main()  takes the argument pipe_handle  and either parent_pid  for Windows or  tracked_fd  for POSIX: 239
