Building a Module From Input execute code provided via several options. 
##Input String From the Command Line 

 CPython can execute a small Python application at the command line with the  -c  option. For example to execute  print(2 ** 2) : $ ./python -c "print(2 ** 2)" 4 The  pymain_run_command()  function is executed inside  Modules main.c taking the command passed in  -c  as an argument in the C type  wchar_- t* . Note The  wchar_t*  type is often used as a low-level storage type for Unicode data across CPython as the size of the type can store UTF8 characters. When converting the  wchar_t*  to a Python string, the  Objects unicodeobject.c Ô¨Åle has a helper function PyUnicode_- FromWideChar()  that returns Unicode string. The encoding to UTF8 is then done by  PyUnicode_AsUTF8String() . Python Unicode Strings are covered in depth in the Unicode String Type section of the Objects and Types chapter. Once this is complete,  pymain_run_command()  will then pass the Python bytes object to  PyRun_SimpleStringFlags()  for execution. The  PyRun_SimpleStringFlags()  function is part of  Python pythonrun.c . Its purpose is to turn a string into a Python module and then send it on to be executed. A Python module needs to have an entry-point, ( __main__ ), to be executed as a standalone module. PyRun_SimpleStringFlags()  creates the entry point implicitly. Once  PyRun_SimpleStringFlags()  has created a module and a dictionary, 89
