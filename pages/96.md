Concrete Syntax Tree Generation In the grammar chapter, you explored some expression types, such as if_stmt  and  with_stmt . The Concrete Syntax Tree represents grammar symbols (like  if_stmt ) as branches, with tokens and terminals as leaf nodes. For example, the arithmetic expression “ a + 1 ” becomes the CST: arith_expr term factor power atom_expr atom NAME ‘a’ PLUS ‘+’ term factor power atom_expr atom NUMBER 1 An arithmetic expression is represented here with three major branches, the left, operator, and right. The parser iterates through tokens from an input stream and matches it against the possible states and tokens in the grammar to build a CST. In  Grammar Grammar , all of the symbols shown in the CST above are deﬁned: arith_expr: term (('+'|'-') term)* term: factor (('*'|'@'|'/'|'%'|'//') factor)* factor: ('+'|'-'|'~') factor | power power: atom_expr ['**' factor] atom_expr: [AWAIT] atom trailer* atom: ('(' [yield_expr|testlist_comp] ')' | '[' [testlist_comp] ']' | 96
