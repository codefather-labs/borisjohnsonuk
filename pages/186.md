Design of the Python Memory Management System } for  ( int  i =  0  ; i < number ; i++ ){ printf( "%f F is %f Cn" , f_values[i], c_values[i]); } free(c_values); free(f_values); return  0 ; } If you execute this with the argument  4 , it will print: 100.000000 F is 37.777778 C 110.000000 F is 43.333334 C 120.000000 F is 48.888888 C 130.000000 F is 54.444444 C This example uses dynamic memory allocation to allocate a block of memory from the heap and then free’s the memory back to the heap upon completion. If any memory that is dynamically allocated is not freed, it will cause a memory leak.

#Management System 

 Being built on top of C, CPython has to use the constraints of  static , automatic , and  dynamic  memory allocation. There are some design aspects of the Python language that make those constraints even more challenging: 1. Python is a dynamically typed language. The size of variables cannot be calculated at compile-time 2. Most of Python’s core types are dynamically sized. The  list  type can be of any size,  dict  can have any number of keys, even  int  is 186
