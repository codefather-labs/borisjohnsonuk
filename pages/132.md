Core Compilation Process 
#Core Compilation Process 

 Now that the  PyAST_CompileObject()  has a compiler state, a symtable, and a module in the form of the AST, the actual compilation can begin. The purpose of the core compiler is to: 1. Convert the state, symtable, and AST into a  Control-Flow-Graph (CFG) 2. Protect the execution stage from runtime exceptions by catching any logic and code errors 
##Accessing the Compiler From Python 

 You can call the compiler in Python by calling the built-in function compile() . It returns a  code object : >>>  compile( 'b+1' ,  'test.py' , mode = 'eval' ) < code object  < module >  at  0x10f222780 , file  "test.py" , line  1 > The same as with the  symtable()  API, a simple expression should have a mode of  'eval' , and a module, function, or class should have a mode of  'exec' . The compiled code can be found in the  co_code  property of the code object: >>>  co.co_code b 'e\x00d\x00\x17\x00S\x00' There is also a  dis  module in the standard library, which disassembles the bytecode instructions. You can print them on the screen, or get a list of  Instruction  instances. Note The  Instruction  type in the  dis  module is a reflection of the  instr type in the C API. 132
