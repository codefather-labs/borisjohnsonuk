The Structure of a Process To control these processes, the OS provides an API to start a new process. When a process is created, it is registered by the Operating System so that it knows which processes are running. Processes are given a unique ID (PID). Depending on the Operating System, they have other properties. POSIX processes have a minimum set of properties, registered in the Operating System: • Controlling Terminal • Current Working Directory • Eﬀective Group ID, Eﬀective User ID • File Descriptors, File Mode Creation Mask • Process Group ID, Process ID • Real Group ID, Real User ID • Root Directory You can see these attributes for running processes in macOS or Linux by running the  ps  command. See Also The  IEEE POSIX Standard (1003.1-2017)  deﬁnes the interface and standard behaviors for processes and threads. Windows has a similar list of properties but sets its own standard. The Windows ﬁle permissions, directory structures, and process registry are very diﬀerent from POSIX. Windows processes, represented by Win32_Process , can be queried in WMI, the Windows Management Interface runtime, or by using the Task Manager. Once a process is started on an Operating System, it is given: • A  Stack  of memory for calling subroutines • A  Heap  (see Dynamic Memory Allocation in C) 229
