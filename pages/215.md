Garbage Collection 0, the object is ﬁnalized, and the memory is freed. Many of the Python  container types , like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets, could result in cyclical references. The reference counter is an insuﬃcient mechanism to ensure that objects which are no longer required are freed. While creating cyclical references in containers should be avoided, there are many examples within the standard library and the core interpreter. Here is another common example, where a container type ( class ) can refer to itself: cpython-book-samples 32 user.py __all__  =  [ 'User' ] class  User(BaseUser): name:  'str'  =  "" login:  'str'  =  "" def  __init__ ( self , name, login): self .name  =  name self .login  =  login super(User). __init__ () def  __repr__ ( self ): return  "" class  BaseUser: def  __repr__ ( self ): # This creates a cyclical reference return  User. __repr__ ( self ) In this example, the instance of  User  links to the  BaseUser  type, which references back to the instance of  User . The goal of the garbage collector is to ﬁnd  unreachable  objects and mark them as garbage. 215
