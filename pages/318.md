The Standard Library Python has always come “batteries included.” This statement means that with a standard CPython distribution, there are libraries for working with ﬁles, threads, networks, web sites, music, keyboards, screens, text, and a whole manner of utilities. Some of the batteries that come with CPython are more like AA batteries. They’re useful for everything, like the  collections  module and the sys  module. Some of them are a bit more obscure, like a small watch battery that you never know when it might come in useful. There are two types of modules in the CPython standard library: 1. Those written in pure Python that provide a utility 2. Those written in C with Python wrappers You will explore both types in this chapter. 
#Python Modules 

 The modules written in pure Python are all located in the  Lib  directory in the source code. Some of the larger modules have submodules in subfolders, like the  email  module. An easy module to look at would be the  colorsys  module. It’s only a few hundred lines of Python code. You may not have come across it before. The  colorsys  module has some utility functions for converting color scales. 318
