#Setting up Visual Studio 

 The newest version of Visual Studio, Visual Studio 2019, has builtin support for Python and the C source code on Windows. I recommend it for this book. If you already have Visual Studio 2017 installed, that would also work. Note None of the paid features are required for compiling CPython or this book. You can use the free, Community edition of Visual Studio. The Proﬁle-Guided-Optimization build proﬁle requires the Professional Edition or higher. Visual Studio is available for free from  Microsoft’s Visual Studio website . Once you’ve downloaded the Visual Studio installer, you’ll be asked to select which components you want to install. The bare minimum for this book is: • The  Python Development  workload • The optional  Python native development tools • Python 3 64-bit (3.7.2) (can be deselected if you already have Python 3.7 installed) Deselect any other optional features if you want to be more conscientious with disk space. The installer will then download and install all of the required components. The installation could take an hour, so you may want to read on and come back to this section. 26
