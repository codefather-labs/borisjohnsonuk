Garbage Collection Some GC algorithms, like mark-and-sweep, or stop-and-copy start at the root of the system and explore all  reachable  objects. This is hard to do in CPython because C extension modules can deﬁne and store their own objects. You could not easily determine all objects by simply looking at  locals()  and  globals() . For long-running processes, or large data processing tasks, running out of memory would cause a signiﬁcant issue. Instead, the CPython garbage collector leverages the existing reference counter and a custom garbage collector algorithm to ﬁnd all  unreachable  objects. Because the reference counter is already in place, the role of the CPython garbage collector is to look for cyclical references in certain container types. 
##Container Types Included in GC 

 The Garbage Collector will look for types that have the flag  Py_- TPFLAGS_HAVE_GC  set in their type deﬁnition. You will cover type deﬁnitions in the chapter Objects in CPython. Types that are marked for garbage collection are: • Class, Method and Function objects • Cell Objects • Byte arrays, Byte, and Unicode strings • Dictionaries • Descriptor Objects, used in attributes • Enumeration Objects • Exceptions • Frame Objects • Lists, Tuples, Named Tuples and Sets • Memory Objects • Modules and Namespaces 216
