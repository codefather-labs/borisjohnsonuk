The Compiler After completing the task of parsing, the interpreter has an AST with the operations, functions, classes, and namespaces of the Python code. The job of the  compiler  is to turn the AST into instructions the CPU could understand. File Input IO Stream  Input String Input Compiler Reader Parser This compilation task is split into two components: 1.  Compiler  - Traverse the AST and create a  control-ï¿½ow-graph (CFG), which represents the logical sequence for execution 2.  Assembler  - Convert the nodes in the CFG to sequential, executable statements, known as  bytecode 119
