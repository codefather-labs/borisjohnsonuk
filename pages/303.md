Unicode String Type The Unicode Code charts are published on the  Unicode Website . Another point of support for Unicode is the Web Browser. Web Browsers decode HTML binary data in the encoding marked HTTP encoding headers. If you are working with CPython as a web server, then your Unicode encodings must match the HTTP headers being sent to your users. 
##UTF8 vs UTF16 

 Some common encodings are: •  UTF8 , an 8-bit character encoding that supports all possible characters in the UCD with either a 1-4 byte code point •  UTF16 , a 16-bit character encoding, similar to UTF8, but not compatible with 7 or 8-bit encodings like ASCII UTF8 is the most commonly used Unicode encoding. In all Unicode encodings, the code points can be represented using a hexadecimal shorthand: •  U+00F7  for the division character  '÷' •  U+0107  for the Latin Small Letter C with acute  'ć' In Python, Unicode code points can be encoded directly into the code using the  u  escape symbol and the hexadecimal value of the code point: >>>  print( "u0107" ) ć CPython does not attempt to pad this data, so if you tried  u107 , it would give the following exception: print( "u107" ) File  "<stdin>" , line  1 SyntaxError : (unicode error)  'unicodeescape'  codec can 't decode bytes in position 0-4: truncated uXXXX escape 303
