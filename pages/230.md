The Structure of a Process • Access to  Files ,  Locks , and  Sockets  on the Operating System The CPU on your computer also keeps additional data when the process is executing, such as : •  Registers  holding the current instruction being executed or any other data needed by the process for that instruction • An  Instruction Pointer , or  Program Counter  indicating which instruction in the program sequence is being executed The CPython process comprises of the compiled CPython interpreter, and the compiled modules. These modules are loaded at runtime and converted into instructions by the CPython Evaluation Loop: Heap Python Objects Process Memory Process CPython Runtime Files Locks Sockets Compiled Modules Instructions Stack The program register and program counter point to a  single  instruction in the process. This means that only one instruction can be executing at any one time. For CPython, this means that only one Python bytecode instruction can be executing at any one time. There are two main approaches to allowing parallel execution of instructions in a process: 1. Fork another process 230
