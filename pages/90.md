Building a Module From Input it calls  PyRun_StringFlags() . PyRun_SimpleStringFlags()  creates a fake ﬁlename and then calls the Python parser to create an AST from the string and return a module. Note Python modules are the data structure used to hand parsed code onto the compiler. The C structure for a Python module is  mod_ty  and is deﬁned in  Include Python-ast.h . 
##Input with a Local Module 

 Another way to execute Python commands is by using the  -m  option with the name of a module. A typical example is  python -m unittest  to run the unittest module in the standard library. Being able to execute modules as scripts was initially proposed in PEP 338 . The standard for explicit relative imports was deﬁned in PEP366 . The use of the “ -m ” flag implies that within the module package, you want to execute whatever is inside the entry point  ( __main__ ) . It also implies that you want to search  sys.path  for the named module. This search mechanism in the import library ( importlib ) is why you don’t need to remember where the  unittest  module is stored on your ﬁlesystem. CPython imports a standard library module,  runpy  and executes it using  PyObject_Call() . The import is done using the C API function PyImport_ImportModule() , found within the  Python import.c  ﬁle. 90
