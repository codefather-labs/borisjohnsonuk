Multithreading • Async generator counters Similar to the multiprocessing  preparation data , threads have a boot state. However, threads share the same memory space, so there is no need to serialize data and send it over a ﬁle stream. Threads are instantiated with the  threading.Thread  type. This is a highlevel module that abstracts the  PyThread  type.  PyThread  instances are managed by the C extension module  _thread . The  _thread  module has the entry point for executing a new thread, thread_PyThread_start_new_thread() .  start_new_thread()  is a method on an instance of the type  Thread . New threads are instantiated in this sequence: 1. The  bootstate  is created, linking to the  target , with arguments  args and  kwargs 2. The  bootstate  is linked to the interpreter state 3. A new  PyThreadState  is created, linking to the current interpreter 4. The GIL is enabled, if not already with a call to  PyEval_InitThreads() 5. The new thread is started on the Operating System-speciﬁc implementation of  PyThread_start_new_thread 265
