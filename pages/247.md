Multi-Process Parallelism Parent Process Worker Pool Worker 0 Worker 1 [110, 120, 130, 140] Input Queue Output Queue 1 2 0 1 3 0 1 4 0 1 1 0 get() While this worker is busy, the second worker then takes another value from the queue: Parent Process Worker Pool Worker 0 Worker 1 [110, 120, 130, 140] Input Queue Output Queue 1 3 0 1 4 0 1 2 0 (Busy) get() 1 1 0 The Ô¨Årst worker has completed its calculation and puts the resulting value onto the result queue: Parent Process Worker Pool Worker 0 Worker 1 [110, 120, 130, 140] Input Queue Output Queue 1 3 0 1 4 0 (Busy) 43.33 put() 1 2 0 Two queues are in use to separate the input and output values. Eventually, all input values have been processed, and the output queue is full. The values are then printed by the parent process: 247
