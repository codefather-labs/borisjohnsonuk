Using Gdb To exit the session, use the command  quit , or  q . See Also The  LLVM Documentation Tutorial  contains a more exhaustive list of commands. 
##Using the Python-Lldb Extension 

 lldb supports extensions, written in Python. There is an open-source extension which prints additional information in the lldb session for native CPython objects. To install it, run these commands: $ mkdir -p ~/.lldb $ cd ~/.lldb && git clone https://github.com/malor/cpython-lldb $ echo "command script import ~/.lldb/cpython-lldb/cpython_lldb.py" >> ~/.lldbinit $ chmod +x ~/.lldbinit Now, whenever you see variables in lldb, there will be some additional information to the right, such as the numeric value for ints and floats, or the text for Unicode strings. Within a lldb console, there is now an additional command,  py-bt , that prints the stack trace for Python frames. 
#Using Gdb 

 Gdb is a commonly-used debugger for C/C++ applications written on Linux platforms. It is also very popular with the CPython core development team. When CPython is compiled, it generates a script,  cpython-pdb.py . Don’t execute this script directly. Instead, gdb will discover it and run it automatically once conﬁgured. To conﬁgure this stage, edit the  .gdbinit ﬁle inside your home path and add the line: 337
