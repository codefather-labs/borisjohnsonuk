The CPython Memory Allocator • Blocks of the same size are all put into the same  pool  of memory • Pools are grouped into  arenas 
##Blocks, Pools, and Arenas 

 The largest group of memory is an arena. CPython creates arenas of 256KB to align with the system page size. A system page boundary is a ﬁxed-length contiguous chunk of memory. Even with modern, high-speed memory, contiguous memory will load faster than fragmented. It is beneﬁcial to have contiguous memory. Arenas Arenas are allocated against the system heap, and with  mmap()  on systems supporting anonymous memory mappings. Memory mapping helps reduce heap fragmentation of the arenas. This is the representation of 4 arenas within the system heap: System Heap Arena Arena Arena Arena 256KB 256KB 256KB 256KB Arenas have the data struct  arenaobject : Field Type Purpose address uintptr_t Memory address of the arena pool_address block * Pointer to the next pool to be carved oﬀ for allocation nfreepools uint The number of available pools in the arena: free pools + never-allocated pools ntotalpools uint The total number of pools in the arena, whether or not available 191
