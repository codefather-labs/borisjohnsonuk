The Value Stack if  left  or  right: pass The  or  operation would be compiled into a  BINARY_OR  instruction by the compiler: static int binop( struct  compiler *c, operator_ty op) { switch  (op) { case  Add: return  BINARY_ADD; ... case  BitOr: return  BINARY_OR; In the evaluation loop, the case for a  BINARY_OR  will take two values from the value stack, the left, and right operation, then call  PyNumber_- Or  against those 2 objects: ... case  TARGET(BINARY_OR): { PyObject *right = POP(); PyObject *left = TOP(); PyObject *res = PyNumber_Or(left, right); Py_DECREF(left); Py_DECREF(right); SET_TOP(res); if  (res == NULL) goto  error; DISPATCH(); } The result,  res , is then set as the top of the stack, overriding the current top value. 170
