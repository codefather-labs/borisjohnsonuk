What Readers Say About  CPython Internals: Your Guide to the Python 3 Interpreter “A comprehensive walkthrough of the Python internals, a topic which surprisingly has almost no good resource, in an easy-to-understand manner for both beginners as well as advanced Python users.” —  Abhishek Sharma , Data Scientist “The ‘Parallelism and Concurrency’ chapter is one of my favorites. I had been looking to get an in depth understanding around this topic and I found your book extremely helpful. Of course, after going over that chapter I couldn’t resist the rest. I am eagerly looking forward to have my own printed copy once it’s out! I had gone through your ‘Guide to CPython Source code’ article previously which got me interested in ﬁnding out more about the internals. There are a ton of books on Python which teach the language, but I haven’t really come across anything that would go about explaining the internals to those curious minded. And while I teach Python to my daughter currently, I have this book added in her must-read list. She’s currently studying Information Systems at Georgia State University.” —  Milan Patel , Vice President at (a major investment bank)
