Multithreading Py_UNREACHABLE(); } errno = err; PyThreadState_Swap(tstate); } This is not the only system call wrapped by the non-GIL-blocking pair Py_BEGIN_ALLOW_THREADS  and  Py_END_ALLOW_THREADS . There are over 300 uses of it in the Standard Library. Including: • Making HTTP requests • Interacting with local hardware • Encryption • Reading and writing ﬁles 
##Thread State 

 CPython provides its own implementation of thread management. Because threads need to execute Python bytecode in the evaluation loop, running a thread in CPython isn’t as simple as spawning an OS thread. Python threads are called  PyThread , and you covered them briefly on the CPython Evaluation Loop chapter. Python threads execute code objects and are spawned by the interpreter. To recap: • CPython has a single runtime, which has its own  runtime state • CPython can have one or many interpreters • An interpreter has a state, called the  interpreter state • An interpreter will take a  code object  and convert it into a series of  frame objects • An interpreter has at least one  thread , each thread has a  thread state 263
