Bool and Long Integer Type See Also There are many layers to custom types, that have been extensively documented in many Python books. I could ﬁll an entire book on metaclasses, but have decided to stick to the implementation. If you want to learn more, check out  John Sturtz’ article on metaprogramming . 
#Bool and Long Integer Type 

 The  bool  type is the most straightforward implementation of the builtin types. It inherits from  long  and has the predeﬁned constants,  Py_- True  and  Py_False . These constants are  immutable  instances, created on the instantiation of the Python interpreter. Inside  Objects boolobject.c , you can see the helper function to create a  bool  instance from a number: Objects boolobject.c  line 28 PyObject *PyBool_FromLong( long  ok) { PyObject *result; if  (ok) result = Py_True; else result = Py_False; Py_INCREF(result); return  result; } This function uses the C evaluation of a numeric type to assign  Py_True or  Py_False  to a result and increment the reference counters. The numeric functions for  and ,  xor , and  or  are implemented, but addition, subtraction, and division are dereferenced from the base long type since it would make no sense to divide two boolean values. 296
