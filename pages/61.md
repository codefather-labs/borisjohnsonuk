The Python Language and Grammar The purpose of a compiler is to convert one language into another. Think of a compiler like a translator. You would hire a translator to listen to you speaking in English and then speak in Japanese. To accomplish this, the translator must understand the grammatical structures of the source and target languages. Some compilers will compile into a low-level machine code, which can be executed directly on a system. Other compilers will compile into an intermediary language, to be executed by a virtual machine. A consideration when choosing a compiler is the system portability requirements.  Java  and  .NET CLR  will compile into an Intermediary Language so that the compiled code is portable across multiple systems architectures. C, Go, C++, and Pascal will compile into an executable binary. This binary is built for the platform on which it was compiled. Python applications are typically distributed as source code. The role of the Python interpreter is to convert the Python source code and execute it in one step. The CPython runtime does compile your code when it runs for the ﬁrst time. This step is invisible to the regular user. Python code is not compiled into machine code; it is compiled into a low-level intermediary language called  bytecode . This bytecode is stored in  .pyc  ﬁles and cached for execution. If you run the same 61
