Using the Python Benchmark Suite for Runtime Benchmarks $ ./python -m timeit -n 1000 "x=1.0001; y=1.0000; x~=y" 1000 loops, best of 5: 172 nsec per loop You might notice a minor (1-5%) improvement in performance. Experiment with diï¬€erent implementations of the comparison to see if you can improve it further.

#Runtime Benchmarks 

 The benchmark suite is the tool to use when comparing the complete performance of Python. The Python Benchmark suite is a collection of Python applications designed to test multiple aspects of the Python runtime under load. The Benchmark suite tests are pure-Python, so they can be used to test multiple runtimes, like PyPy and Jython. They are also compatible with Python 2.7 through to the latest version. Any commits to the master branch on  github.com/python/cpython will be tested using the benchmark tool, and the results uploaded to the  Python Speed Center at speed.python.org : 356
