Using the Python Benchmark Suite for Runtime Benchmarks 
![page_357_1](images/page_357_1.jpeg)
 You can compare commits, branches, and tags side by side on the speed center. The benchmarks use both the Proﬁle Guided Optimization and regular builds with a ﬁxed hardware conﬁguration to produce stable comparisons. To install the Python benchmark suite, install it from PyPi using a Python runtime (not the one you are testing) in a virtual environment: (venv) $ pip install performance Next, you need to create a conﬁguration ﬁle and an output directory for the test proﬁle. It is recommended to create this directory outside of your Git working directory. This also allows you to checkout multiple versions. In the conﬁguration ﬁle, e.g.,  ~/benchmarks/benchmark.cfg , put the following contents: cpython-book-samples 62 benchmark.cfg 357
