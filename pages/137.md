Core Compilation Process The compiler emits  blocks  to the compiler state. These blocks contain a sequence of instructions. The instruction data structure has an opcode, arguments, the target block (if this is a jump instruction), and the line number of the statement. Instruction Type The instruction type,  instr , is deﬁned as: Field Type Purpose i_jabs unsigned Flag to specify this is a absolute jump instruction i_jrel unsigned Flag to specify this is a relative jump instruction i_opcode unsigned char Opcode number this instruction represents (see Include Opcode.h ) i_oparg int Opcode argument i_target basicblock* Pointer to the  basicblock  target when  i_jrel  is true i_lineno int Line number this instruction was created for Jump Instructions Jump instructions can either be absolute or relative. Jump instructions are used to “jump” from one instruction to another. Absolute jump instructions specify the exact instruction number in the compiled code object, whereas relative jump instructions specify the jump target relative to another instruction. 
##Basic Frame Blocks 

 A basic frame block (of type  basicblock ), contains the following ﬁelds: Field Type Purpose b_list basicblock * Each  basicblock  in a compilation unit is linked via  b_list  in the reverse order that the block are allocated b_iused int Number of instructions used ( b_instr ) b_ialloc int Length of instruction array ( b_instr ) b_instr instr * Pointer to an array of instructions, initially  NULL 137
