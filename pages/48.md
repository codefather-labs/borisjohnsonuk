#Installing a Custom Version 

 From your source repository, if you’re happy with your changes and want to use them inside your system, you can install it as a custom version. For macOS and Linux, you can use the  altinstall  command, which won’t create symlinks for  python3  and install a standalone version: $ make altinstall For Windows, you have to change the build conﬁguration from  Debug to  Release , then copy the packaged binaries to a directory on your computer which is part of the system path. 
#A Quick Primer on Make 

 As a Python developer, you might not have come across  make  before, or perhaps you have but haven’t spent much time with it. For C, C++, and other compiled languages, the number of commands you need to execute to load, link, and compile your code in the right order can be exhaustive. When compiling applications from source, you need to link any external libraries in the system. It would be unrealistic to expect the developer to know the locations of all of these libraries and copy+paste them into the command line, so  make  and  configure are commonly used in C/C++ projects to automate the creation of a build script. When you executed  ./configure ,  autoconf  searched your system for the libraries that CPython requires and copied their paths into  Makefile . The generated  Makefile  is similar to a shell script, broken into sections called  “targets.” 48
