##Assembler Depth-First-Search Algorithm 

 The assembler uses a Depth-First-Search to traverse the nodes in the basic frame block graph. The DFS algorithm is not speciﬁc to CPython, but is a commonly used algorithm in graph traversal. The CST and AST were both tree structures, whereas the compiler state is a graph structure, where the nodes are basic frame blocks containing instructions. The basic frame blocks are linked by two graphs, one is in reverse order of creation (the  b_list  property of each block). A series of basic frame blocks arbitrarily named A-P would look like this: 139
