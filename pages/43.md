#### The New async def Keywords
 Let us begin with the simplest possible thing, shown in  Example 3-4 . *Example 3-4. Async functions are functions, not coroutines* `>>>` ` ` `async` ` ` `def` ` ` `f` `():` `  ` `...` `   ` `return` ` ` `123` `...` `>>>` ` ` `type` `(` `f` `)` `  ` `<` `class` ` ` `'` `function` `'>` `>>>` ` ` `import` ` ` `inspect` `  ` `>>>` ` ` `inspect` `.` `iscoroutinefunction` `(` `f` `)` `  ` `True` This is the simplest possible declaration of a coroutine: it looks like a regular function, except that it begins with the keywords  `async def` . Surprise! The precise type of  `f`  is  *not*  “coroutine”; it’s just an ordinary function. While it is common to refer to  `async def`  functions as coroutines, strictly speaking they are considered by Python to be  *coroutine functions* . This behavior is identical to the way generator functions work in Python: `>>>` ` ` `def` ` ` `g` `():` `...` `     ` `yield` ` ` `123` `...` `>>>` ` ` `type` `(` `g` `)` `<` `class` ` ` `'` `function` `'>` `>>>` ` ` `gen` ` ` `=` ` ` `g` `()` `>>>` ` ` `type` `(` `gen` `)` `<` `class` ` ` `'` `generator` `'>` Even though  `g`  is sometimes incorrectly referred to as a “generator,” it remains a function, and it is only when this function is  *evaluated*  that the generator is returned. Coroutine functions work in exactly the same way: you need to  *call*  the `async def`  function to obtain the coroutine object. The  `inspect`  module in the standard library can provide much better introspective capabilities than the  `type()`  built-in function. There is an  `iscoroutinefunction()`  function that lets you distinguish between an ordinary function and a coroutine function. Returning to our  `async def f()` ,  Example 3-5  reveals what happens when we call it. **32 ** **| ** **Chapter 3: Asyncio Walk-Through**
