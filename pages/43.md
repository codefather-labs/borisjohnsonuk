Compiling CPython Now that you have CPython downloaded a development environment and conﬁgured it, you can compile the CPython source code into an executable interpreter. Unlike Python ﬁles, C source code must be recompiled each time it changes. So you’ll probably want to bookmark this chapter and memorize some of the steps because you’ll be repeating them a lot. In the previous chapter, you saw how to set up your development environment, with an option to run the “Build” stage, which recompiles CPython. Before the build steps work, you require a C compiler, and some build tools. The tools used depend on the operating system you’re using, so skip ahead to the section for your Operating System. Note If you’re concerned that any of these steps will interfere with your existing CPython installations, don’t worry. The CPython source directory behaves like a virtual environment. For compiling CPython, modifying the source, and the standard library, this all stays within the sandbox of the source directory. If you want to install your custom version, this step is covered in this chapter. 43
