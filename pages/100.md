The CPython Parser-Tokenizer Before execution, the parser-tokenizer establishes  tok_state , a temporary data structure to store all state used by the tokenizer. The tokenizer state contains information such as the current cursor position and line. The parser-tokenizer calls  tok_get()  to get the next token. The parsertokenizer passes the resulting token ID to the parser, which uses the parser-generator DFA to create a node on the Concrete Syntax Tree. tok_get()  is one of the most complex functions in the whole CPython codebase. It has over 640 lines and includes decades of heritage with edge cases, new language features, and syntax. The process of calling the tokenizer and parser in a loop can be shown as: Init Tokenizer State Get next token P a r s e r - T o k e n i z e r Tokenizer Parse Token Add node to CST Parser Text CST ID Node The CST root  node  returned by  PyParser_ParseFileObject()  is going to be essential for the next stage, converting a CST into an Abstract-SyntaxTree (AST).
