Memory Management The two most important parts of your computer are the memory and the CPU. They cannot work without the other, they must be utilized well, and they must be performant. When designing a programming language, the authors need to make a vital trade-oﬀ:- “How should the user manage computer memory?” There are many solutions to this question. It depends on how simple you want the interface to be, whether you want the language to be cross-platform, whether you value performance over stability. The authors of Python have made those decisions for you and left you with some additional ones to make yourself. In this chapter, you will explore how C manages memory, since CPython is written in C. You’ll look at two critical aspects to managing memory in Python -  reference counting  and  garbage collection . By the end of this chapter, you will understand how CPython allocates memory on the Operating System, how object memory is allocated and freed, and how CPython manages memory leaks. 
#Memory Allocation in C 

 In C, variables must have their memory allocated from the Operating System before they can be used. 182
