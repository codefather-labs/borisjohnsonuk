Using Lldb for macOS (lldb) break set --file Objects/floatobject.c --line 532 Breakpoint 1: where = python.exe`float_richcompare + 2276 at floatobject.c:532:26, address = 0x000000010006a974 Note There is also a short-hand version of setting breakpoints, e.g.  (lldb) b Objects/floatobject.c:532 You can add multiple breakpoints using the  break set  command. To list the current breakpoints, use the  break list  command: (lldb) break list Current breakpoints: 1: file = 'Objects/floatobject.c', line = 532, exact_match = 0, locations = 1 1.1: where = python.exe`float_richcompare + 2276 at floatobject.c:532:26, address = python.exe[...], unresolved, hit count = 0 
##Starting CPython 

 To start CPython, use the  process launch --  command with the command-line options you would normally use for Python, e.g.: To start python with a string, e.g.  python -c "print(1)" , use: (lldb) process launch -- -c "print(1)" To start python with a script, use: (lldb) process launch -- my_script.py 
##Attaching to a Running CPython Interpreter 

 If you have a CPython interpreter running already, you can attach to it. From inside the lldb session, run  process attach --pid  with the process id: 334
