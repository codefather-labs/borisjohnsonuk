##Spawning and Forking Processes 

 The multiprocessing package oﬀers three methods to start a new parallel process. 1. Forking an Interpreter (on POSIX only) 2. Spawning a new Interpreter process (on POSIX and Windows) 3. Running a Fork Server, where a new process is created which then forks any number of processes (on POSIX only) Note For Windows and macOS, the default start method is Spawning. For Linux, the default is Forking. You can override the default method using the  multiprocessing.set_start_method()  function. The Python API for starting a new process takes a callable,  target , and a tuple of arguments,  args . Take this simple example of spawning a new process to convert Fahrenheit to Celcius: 235
