Constructing Frame Objects Loading Keyword Arguments If the function was called with keyword arguments and values, a dictionary is ﬁlled with any remaining keyword arguments passed by the caller that doesn’t resolve to named arguments or positional arguments. For example, the  e  argument was neither positional or named, so it is added to  **remaining : >>>  def  my_function(a, b, c = None , d = None ,  ** remaining): print(a, b, c, d, remaining) >>>  my_function(a = 1 , b = 2 , c = 3 , d = 4 , e = 5 ) ( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ,  4 , { 'e' :  5 }) 163
