The Value Stack 
##Value Stack Simulations 

 To understand the evaluation loop, you have to understand the value stack. One way to think of the value stack is like a wooden peg on which you can stack cylinders. You would only add or remove one item at a time. This is done using the  PUSH(a)  macro, where  a  is a pointer to a  PyObject . For example, if you created a  PyLong  with the value 10 and pushed it onto the value stack: PyObject *a = PyLong_FromLong( 10 ); PUSH(a); This action would have the following eï¬€ect: a a Before After In the next operation, to fetch that value, you would use the  POP() macro to take the top value from the stack: PyObject *a = POP(); // a is PyLongObject with a value of 10 This action would return the top value and end up with an empty value stack: 171
