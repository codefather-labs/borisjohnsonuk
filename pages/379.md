C Preprocessor ments. Let’s start with the most frequent preprocessor directive,  #include . #include #include  is used to pull the contents of one ﬁle into the current source ﬁle. There is nothing sophisticated about this, it reads that ﬁle from the ﬁle system, runs the preprocessor on that ﬁle and puts the results of that into the output ﬁle. This is done recursively for each  #include directive found. For example, if you look at the  Modules/_multiprocessing/semaphore.c ﬁle, near the top you’ll see: #include  "multiprocessing.h" This tells the preprocessor to pull in the entire contents of multiprocessing.h  and put it into the output ﬁle at this position. You will notice two diﬀerent forms for the include statement. One of them uses quotes to specify the name of the include ﬁle, the other uses angle brackets ( <> ). The diﬀerence comes from which paths are searched when looking for the ﬁle on the ﬁle system. If you use  <>  for the ﬁlename, the preprocessor will only look on “system” include ﬁles. Using quotes around the ﬁlename instead will force the preprocessor to look in the local directory ﬁrst and then fall back to the system directories. #define #define  allows you to do simple text substitution and also plays into the  #if  directives we’ll see below. At it’s most basic,  #define  let’s you deﬁne a new symbol that gets replaced with a text string in the preprocessor output. Continuing in  semphore.c  you’ll ﬁnd this line: 379
