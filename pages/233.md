Multi-Process Parallelism the parent process prints the Ô¨Ånal output before the 3rd and 4th print their own. A parent process can exit, with its own exit code before a child process. Child Processes will be added to a Process Group by the Operating System, making it easier to control all related processes: Process Group Parent Process Heap Python Objects Process Memory Process CPython Runtime Files Locks Sockets Compiled Modules Instructions Stack Heap Python Objects Process Memory Process CPython Runtime Files Locks Sockets Compiled Modules Instructions Stack The biggest downside with this approach to parallelism is that the child process is a complete copy of the parent process. In the case of CPython, this means you would have 2 CPython interpreters running, and both would have to load the modules and all the 233
