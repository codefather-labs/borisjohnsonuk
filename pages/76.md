A More Complex Example the compiler. In practice, most changes to the grammar are more complicated. Python 3.8 introduced assignment expressions, with the format  := . An assignment expression both assigns a value to a name and returns the value of the named variable. One of the statements impacted by the addition of assignment expressions to the Python language was the  if  statement. Prior to 3.8, the  if  statement was deﬁned as: • The keyword  if  followed by a test, then a  : • A nested series of statements ( suite ) • Zero-or-more  elif  statements, which are followed by a test, a  :  and a  suite • An optional  else  statement, which is followed by a  :  and a  suite In the grammar this was represented as: if_stmt: 'if' test ':' suite ('elif' test ':' suite)* ['else' ':' suite] Visualized, this looks like: if if test : suite elif test : suite < else : suite To support assignment expressions, the change needed to be backward compatible. The use of  :=  in an  if  statement, therefore, had to be optional. The  test  token type used in the  if  statement is generic between many statements. For example, the  assert  statement is followed by a  test (and then optionally a second  test ). 76
