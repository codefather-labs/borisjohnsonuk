A More Complex Example assert_stmt: 'assert' test [',' test] An alternate  test  token type was added in 3.8, so that the grammar could be prescriptive about which statements should support assignment expressions and which should not. This is called  namedexpr_test  and is deÔ¨Åned in the Grammar as: namedexpr_test: test [':=' test] Or, visualized in a Railroad Diagram: test := test The new syntax for the if statement was changed to replace  test  with namedexpr_test : if_stmt: 'if' namedexpr_test ':' suite ('elif' namedexpr_test ':' suite) ['else' ':' suite] Visualized in a Railroad Diagram: if if namedexpr_test : suite elif namedexpr_test : suite < else : suite To distinguish between  :=  and the existing COLON ( : ) and EQUAL ( = ) token, the following token was then added to  Grammar Tokens COLONEQUAL ':=' This is not the only change required to support assignment expressions. The change altered many parts of the CPython compiler, as seen in  the Pull Request . 77
