Core Compilation Process switch  (s->kind) { case  FunctionDef_kind: return  compiler_function(c, s,  0 ); case  ClassDef_kind: return  compiler_class(c, s); ... case  For_kind: return  compiler_for(c, s); ... } return  1 ; } As an example, the  For  statement in Python is: for  i  in  iterable: # block else : # optional if iterable is False # block Or shown as a railroad diagram: for exprlist in testlist : TYPE_COMMENT suite else : suite If the statement is a  For  type,  compiler_visit_stmt()  calls  compiler_for() . There is an equivalent  compiler_*()  function for all of the statement and expression types. The more straightforward types create the bytecode instructions inline, some of the more complex statement types call other functions. 
##Instructions 

 Many of the statements can have sub-statements. A  for  loop has a body, but you can also have complex expressions in the assignment and the iterator. 136
