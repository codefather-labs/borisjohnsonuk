A More Complex Example DFA 'funcdef', state 5: [switch func_body_suite to suite] Push 'suite' DFA 'suite', state 0: Shift. Token INDENT/'' ... It's a token we know DFA 'suite', state 1: Shift. Token NAME/'proceed' ... It's a keyword DFA 'suite', state 3: Push 'stmt' ... ACCEPT. In the output, you can see that it highlighted  proceed  as a keyword. In the next chapter, weâ€™ll see how executing the Python binary gets to the tokenizer and what happens from there to execute your code. Note To clean up your code, revert the change in  Grammar Grammar , regenerate the grammar again, then clean the build, and recompile: For macOS or Linux: $ git checkout -- Grammar/Grammar $ make regen-grammar $ make clobber $ make -j2 -s Or for Windows: > git checkout -- Grammar/Grammar > build.bat --regen > build.bat -t CleanAll > build.bat -t Build 
#A More Complex Example 

 Adding  proceed  as an alternate keyword for  pass  is a simple change, the parser generator does the work of matching  'proceed'  as a literal for the  pass_stmt  token. This new keyword works without any changes to 75
