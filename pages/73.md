Regenerating Grammar COMMA ',' SEMI ';' As with the  Grammar  ﬁle, if you change the  Grammar Tokens  ﬁle, you need to rerun  pgen . To see tokens in action, you can use the  tokenize  module in CPython. Note There are two tokenizers in the CPython source code. One tokenizer written in Python demonstrated here, and another written in C. The tokenizer written in Python is a utility, and the Python interpreter uses the one written in C. They have identical output and behavior. The version written in C is designed for performance, and the module in Python is designed for debugging. Create a simple Python script called  test_tokens.py : cpython-book-samples 13 test_tokens.py # Demo application def  my_function(): proceed Input the  test_tokens.py  ﬁle to a module built into the standard library called  tokenize . You will see the list of tokens by line and character. Use the  -e  flag to output the exact token name: $ ./python -m tokenize -e test_tokens.py 0,0-0,0: ENCODING 'utf-8' 1,0-1,14: COMMENT '# Demo application' 1,14-1,15: NL '\n' 2,0-2,3: NAME 'def' 2,4-2,15: NAME 'my_function' 2,15-2,16: LPAR '(' 73
