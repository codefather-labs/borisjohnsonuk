The  type  Type All type slots are given a unique number, deﬁned in Include typeslots.h . When referring to, or fetching a type slot on an object, use these constants. For example,  tp_repr  has a constant position of  66 , and the constant Py_tp_repr  always matches the type slot position. These constants are useful when checking if an object implements a particular type slot function. 
##Working with Types in C 

 Within C extension modules and the core CPython code, you will be frequently working with the  PyObject*  type. As an example, if you run  x[n]  on a subscriptable object like a list, or string, it will call  PyObject_GetItem()  which looks at the object  x  to determine how to subscript it: Objects abstract.c  line 146 PyObject * PyObject_GetItem(PyObject *o, PyObject *key) { PyMappingMethods *m; PySequenceMethods *ms; ... The  PyObject_GetItem()  function serves both mapping types (like dictionaries) as well as sequence types (like lists and tuples). If the instance,  o  has sequence methods, then  o->ob_type->tp_as_- sequence  will evaluate to true, also if the instance,  o , has a  sq_item  slot function deﬁned, it is assumed that it has corrected implemented the sequence protocol. The value of  key  is evaluated to check that it is an integer, and the item is requested from the sequence object using the  PySequence_GetItem() 294
