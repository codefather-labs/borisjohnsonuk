Multi-Process Parallelism Parent Process Worker Pool Worker 0 Worker 1 [110, 120, 130, 140] Input Queue Output Queue 43.33 48.88 54.44 60.00 This example shows how a pool of workers could receive a queue of small, discreet values and process them in parallel to send the resulting data back to the host process. In practice, converting Celcius to Fahrenheit is a small, trivial calculation unsuited for parallel execution. If the worker process were doing another CPU-intensive calculation, this would provide signiÔ¨Åcant performance improvement on a multi-CPU or multi-core computer. For streaming data instead of discreet queues, pipes can be used instead. Pipes Within the  multiprocessing  package, there is a type  Pipe . Instantiating a Pipe returns two connections, a parent and a child. Both can send and receive data: Parent Process Worker Pool Worker 0 Worker 1 [110, 120, 130, 140] Parent Pipe Child Pipe send() recv() 010101010100011100 100101111001110011 recv() send() (Busy) (Busy) In the queue example, a lock is implicitly placed on the queue when data is sent and received. Pipes do not have that behavior, so you have 248
