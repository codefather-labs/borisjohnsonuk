 The  `asyncio`  library tries to provide sufficient features for both end-user developers and framework designers. Unfortunately, this means that the  `asyncio`  API can appear somewhat sprawling. I hope that this section has provided enough of a road map to help you pick out the parts you need. In the next sections, we’re going to look at the component parts of the preceding list in more detail. The  pysheeet  site provides an in-depth summary (or “cheat sheet”) of large chunks of the  `asyncio`  API; each concept is presented with a short code snippet. The presentation is dense, so I wouldn’t recommend it for beginners, but if you have experience with Python and you’re the kind of person who “gets it” only when new programming info is presented in code, this is sure to be a useful resource. ### Coroutines
 Let’s begin at the very beginning: what is a coroutine? My goal in this section is to help you understand the specific meaning behind terms like  *coroutine object*  and  *asynchronous function* . The examples that follow will show low-level interactions not normally required in most programs; however, the examples will help give you a clearer understanding of the fundamental parts of Asyncio, and will make later sections much easier to grasp. The following examples can all be reproduced in a Python 3.8 interpreter in interactive mode, and I urge you to work through them on your own by typing them yourself, observing the output, and perhaps experimenting with different ways of interacting with  `async`  and  `await` . `asyncio`  was first added to Python 3.4, but the new syntax for coroutines using  `async def`  and  `await`  was only added in Python 3.5. How did people do anything with  `asyncio`  in 3.4? They used  *generators*  in very special ways to act as if they were coroutines. In some older codebases, you’ll see generator functions decorated with `@asyncio.coroutine`  and containing  `yield from`  statements. Coroutines created with the newer  `async def`  are now referred to as  *native coroutines*  because they are built into the language as coroutines and nothing else. This book ignores the older generatorbased coroutines entirely. **Coroutines ** **| ** **31**
