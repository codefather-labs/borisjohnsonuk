Using Timeit for Micro-Benchmarks Proﬁlers are available at a C or Python level. If you are proﬁling a function, module, or script written in Python, you want to use a Python proﬁler. If you are proﬁling a C extension module or a modiﬁcation to the C code in CPython, you need to use a C proﬁler (or a combination). Here is a summary of some of the tools available: Tool Category Level OS Support timeit Benchmarking Python All pyperformance Benchmarking Python All cProﬁle Proﬁling Python All dtrace Tracing/Proﬁling C Linux/ macOS Important Before you run any benchmarks, it is best to close down all applications on your computer so the CPU is dedicated to the benchmark. 
#Using Timeit for Micro-Benchmarks 

 The Python Benchmark suite is a thorough test of CPython’s runtime with multiple iterations. If you want to run a quick, simple comparison of a speciﬁc snippet, use the  timeit  module. To run timeit for a short script, run the compiled CPython with the  -m timeit  module and a script in quotes: $ ./python -m timeit -c "x=1; x+=1; x**x" 1000000 loops, best of 5: 258 nsec per loop To run a smaller number of loops, use the  -n  flag: $ ./python -m timeit -n 1000 "x=1; x+=1; x**x" 1000 loops, best of 5: 227 nsec per loop 354
