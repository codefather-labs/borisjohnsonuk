#### CHAPTER 5
 ### Concluding Thoughts
 When substantial new features appear in Python, they’re new for everybody. I have nearly two decades’ experience with Python, but I still found Asyncio difficult to learn—even taking into account that I had already worked with Twisted and Tornado on previous projects, so event-based programming was not new to me. I found the `asyncio`  API to be much more complex than I had expected. Part of this was due to a lack of high-level documentation. Now, having spent the time to learn how to use Asyncio in Python, I feel a lot more comfortable with it, and this progression will likely be similar for you too. There is a coherent structure and purpose behind the design of the API, and hopefully this book will make it much easier for you to learn than it was for me. With a basic understanding in place, I’m now finding it quite easy to write new Asyncio-based code without having to constantly refer back to the docs: this is a very good sign, and certainly isn’t the case with all the standard library modules. There are still some rough edges, though. The  `asyncio`  standard library will continue to have a large, fine-grained API, since it caters to both framework designers and end-user developers. This means that we—as end-user developers—will have to learn which parts of the API are applicable to us and which are not. In time, as the thirdparty library ecosystem for  `asyncio`  grows and matures, we will likely find ourselves working with those library APIs rather than the raw  `asyncio`  standard library API. Existing libraries like  `aiohttp`  and Sanic are good examples of this. The  `asyncio`  API itself will also continue to improve as more people gain experience with it. I also made unexpected discoveries along the way: by happy coincidence, it turned out that I needed to finally learn ZeroMQ at around the same time this book was being written, and I’m finding that  `asyncio`  in combination with  `pyzmq`  makes network programming a joy. My recommendation for the best way to learn Asyncio is to experiment, try things out and have fun. **129**
