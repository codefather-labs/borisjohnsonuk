Assembly A B C E F G H I J K L M N O P The graph created from the  b_list  is used to sequentially visit every block in a compiler unit The second graph uses the  b_next  property of each block. This list represents the control flow. Vertices in this graph are created by calls to compiler_use_next_block(c, next) , where  next  is the next block to draw a vertex to from the current block ( c->u->u_curblock ). The  For  loop node graph might look something like this: A B C E F G H I J K L M N O P FOR_LOOP End Start Cleanup Body OrElse 140
