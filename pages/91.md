Building a Module From Input Note In Python, if you had an object and wanted to get an attribute, you could call  getattr() . In the C API, this call is  PyObject_- GetAttrString() , which is found in  Objects object.c . If you wanted to run a callable, you would give it parentheses, or you can run the  __call__()  property on any Python object. The __call__()  method is implemented inside  Objects object.c : >>>  my_str  =  "hello world!" >>>  my_str.upper() 'HELLO WORLD!' >>>  my_str.upper. __call__ () 'HELLO WORLD!' The  runpy  module is written in pure Python and located in  Lib runpy.py . Executing  python -m <module>  is equivalent to running  python -m runpy <module> . The  runpy  module was created to abstract the process of locating and executing modules on an Operating System. runpy  does a few things to run the target module: • Calls  __import__()  for the module name you provided • Sets  __name__  (the module name) to a namespace called  __main__ • Executes the module within the  __main__  namespace The  runpy  module also supports executing directories and zip ﬁles.

 If the ﬁrst argument to  python  was a ﬁlename, such as  python test.py , then CPython will open a ﬁlehandle, and pass the handle to  PyRun_- SimpleFileExFlags() , inside  Python pythonrun.c . There are three paths this function can take: 91
