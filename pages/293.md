The  type  Type struct  PyTypeObject --- typedef struct  _typeobject { ... reprfunc tp_repr; ... } PyTypeObject; The signature  reprfunc  is deﬁned in  Include cpython object.h  as having a single argument of  PyObject*  ( self ): typedef  PyObject *(*reprfunc)(PyObject *); As an example, the cell object implements the  tp_repr  slot with the function  cell_repr : PyTypeObject PyCell_Type = { PyVarObject_HEAD_INIT(&PyType_Type,  0 ) "cell" , sizeof (PyCellObject), 0 , (destructor)cell_dealloc, /* tp_dealloc */ 0 , /* tp_vectorcall_offset */ 0 , /* tp_getattr */ 0 , /* tp_setattr */ 0 , /* tp_as_async */ (reprfunc)cell_repr, /* tp_repr */ ... }; Beyond the basic  PyTypeObject  type slots, denoted with the  tp_  preﬁx, there are other type slot deﬁnitions: •  PyNumberMethods  denoted with the preﬁx  nb_ •  PySequenceMethods  denoted with the preﬁx  sq_ •  PyMappingMethods  denoted with the preﬁx  mp_ •  PyAsyncMethods  denoted with the preﬁx  am_ •  PyBufferProcs  denoted with the preﬁ  bf_ 293
