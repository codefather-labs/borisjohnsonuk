Garbage Collection 1. The destructor tells the GC to stop tracking this instance by calling _PyObject_GC_UNTRACK() . Because it has been destroyed, it’s contents don’t need to be checked for changes in subsequent collections. 2.  Py_XDECREF  is a standard call in any destructor to decrement the reference counter. The reference counter for an object is initialized to 1, so this counters that operation. 3. The  PyObject_GC_Del()  will remove this object from the GC linkedlist by calling  gc_list_remove()  and then free the memory with PyObject_FREE() . Objects cellobject.c  line 79 static void cell_dealloc(PyCellObject *op) { _PyObject_GC_UNTRACK(op); Py_XDECREF(op->ob_ref); PyObject_GC_Del(op); } When a collection starts, it will merge younger generations into the current. For example, if you are collecting the second generation, when it starts collecting, it will merge the ﬁrst generation’s objects into the GC list using  gc_list_merge() . The GC will then determine unreachable objects in the  young  (currently targeted) generation. The logic for determining unreachable objects is located in  deduce_- unreachable() . It follows these stages: 1. For every object in the generation, copy the reference count value ob->ob_refcnt  to  ob->gc_ref . 2. For every object, subtract internal (cyclical) references from  gc_- refs  to determine how many objects can be collected by the GC. If gc_refs  ends up equal to 0, that means it is unreachable. 3. Create a list of unreachable objects and add every object that met 220
