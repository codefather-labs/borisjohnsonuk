Multi-Process Parallelism finally : del  process.current_process()._inheriting return  self ._bootstrap(parent_sentinel) The  _bootstrap()  function handles the instantiation of a  BaseProcess instance from the deserialized data, and then the target function is called with the arguments and keyword arguments. This ﬁnal task is completed by  BaseProcess.run() : def  run( self ): ''' Method to be run in sub-process; can be overridden in sub-class ''' if  self ._target: self ._target( * self ._args,  ** self ._kwargs) The exit code of  self._bootstrap()  is set as the exit code, and the child process is terminated. This process allows the parent process to serialize the module and the executable function. It also allows the child process to deserialize that instance, execute the function with arguments, and return. It does not allow for the exchanging of data once the child process has started. This task is done using the extension of the  Queue  and  Pipe objects. If processes are being created in a pool, the ﬁrst process will be ready and in a waiting state. The parent process repeats the process and sends the data to the next worker: 242
