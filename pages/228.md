The Structure of a Process In summary, • To have  parallelism , you need multiple computational units. Computational units can be CPUs or Cores. • To have  concurrency , you need a way of scheduling tasks so that idle ones don’t lock the resources. Many parts of CPython’s design abstract the complexity of Operating Systems to provide a simple API for developers. CPython’s approach to parallelism and concurrency is no exception. 
#Models of Parallelism and Concurrency 

 CPython oﬀers many approaches to Parallelism and Concurrency. Your choice depends on several factors. There are also overlapping use cases across models as CPython has evolved. You may ﬁnd that for a particular problem, there are two or more concurrency implementations to choose from. Each with their own pros and cons. The four bundled models with CPython are: Approach Module Concurrent Parallel Threading threading Yes No Multiprocessing multiprocessing Yes Yes Async asyncio Yes No Subinterpreters subinterpreters Yes Yes 
#The Structure of a Process 

 One of the tasks for an Operating System, like Windows, macOS, or Linux, is to control the running processes. These processes could be UI applications like a browser or IDE. They could also be background processes, like network services or OS services. 228
