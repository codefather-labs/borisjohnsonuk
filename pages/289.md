Examples in This Chapter 2. A dictionary with any custom attributes and methods Much of the base object API is declared in  Objects object.c , like the implementation of the built-in  repr()  function,  PyObject_Repr . You will also ﬁnd  PyObject_Hash()  and other APIs. All of these functions can be overridden in a custom object by implementing “dunder” methods on a Python object. For example: class  MyObject(object): def  __init__ ( self , id, name): self .id  =  id self .name  =  name def  __repr__ ( self ): return  "< {0}  id= {1} >" .format( self .name,  self .id) All of these built-in functions are called the  Python Data Model . Not all methods in a Python object are part of the Data Model, so that a Python object can contain attributes (either class or instance attributes) and methods. See Also One of the great resources for the Python Data Model is  “Fluent Python” by Luciano Ramalho . 
#Examples in This Chapter 

 Throughout this chapter, each type explanation will come with an example. In the example, you will implement the  almost-equal  operator, that was speciﬁed in earlier chapters. If you haven’t yet implemented the changes in the Grammar and Compiler chapters, they will be required to implement the examples. 289
