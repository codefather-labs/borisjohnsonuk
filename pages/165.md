Constructing Frame Objects If a keyword argument is deﬁned with a value, that is available within this scope: def  example(arg1, arg2, example_kwarg = None ): print(example_kwarg) # example_kwarg is already a local variable. Adding Missing Positional Arguments Any positional arguments provided to a function call that are not in the list of positional arguments are added to a  *args  tuple if this tuple does not exist, an exception is raised. Adding Missing Keyword Arguments Any keyword arguments provided to a function call that are not in the list of named keyword arguments are added to a  **kwargs  dictionary if this dictionary does not exist, an exception is raised. Collapsing Closures Any closure names are added to the code object’s list of free variable names. Creating Generators, Coroutines, and Asynchronous Generators If the evaluated code object has a flag that it is a generator, coroutine, or async generator, then a new frame is created using one of the unique methods in the Generator, Coroutine, or Async libraries and the current frame is added as a property. See Also The APIs and implementation of generators, coroutines, and async frames are covered in the chapter on parallelism and concurrency 165
