##Example 

 In the ﬁnal example application, the actual connection code has to be captured in a string. In 3.9.0b1, subinterpreters can only be executed with a string of code. To start each of the subinterpreters, a list of threads is started, with a callback to a function,  run() . This function will: • Create a communication channel • Start a new subinterpreter • Send it the code to execute • Receive data over the communication channel • If the port connection succeeded, add it to the thread-safe queue cpython-book-samples 33 portscanner_subinterpreters.py import  time import  _xxsubinterpreters  as  subinterpreters from  threading  import  Thread 284
