Conclusion how the frame stack system is used for CPython to run on multiple core or CPUs. Also, CPython’s frame object API enables frames to be paused and resumed in the form of asynchronous programming. The loading of variables using a Value Stack needs memory allocation and management. For CPython to run eﬀectively, it has to have a solid Memory Management process. In the next chapter, you’ll explore that memory management process, and how it relates to the PyObject pointers used by the evaluation loop. Leave feedback on this section » 181
