Bonus Material & Learning Resources book is aimed at Intermediate to Advanced Python developers. Every eﬀort has been taken to show code examples, but some intermediate Python techniques will be used throughout the book. Do I need to know C to use this book?  You do not need to be proﬁcient in C to use this book. If you are new to C, check out  Appendix 1: Introduction to C for Python Programmers  at the back of this book for a quick introduction. How long will it take to �nish this book?  I don’t recommend rushing this book, try reading a chapter at a time, trying the examples after each chapter and exploring the code simultaneously. Once you’ve ﬁnished the book, it will make a great reference guide for you to come back to in time. Won’t the content in this book be out of date really quickly? Python has been around for over 20 years. Some parts of the CPython code haven’t been touched since they were originally written. Many of the principles in this book have been the same for ten or more years. In fact, whilst writing this book, I discovered many lines of code written by Guido van Rossum (the author of Python) and untouched since version 1. The skills you’ll learn in this book will help you read and understand current and future versions of CPython. Change is constant, and your expertise is something you can develop along the way. Some of the concepts in this book are brand-new; some are even experimental. While writing this book, I came across issues in the source code and bugs in CPython. Then, they got  ﬁxed or improved . That’s part of the wonder of CPython as a flourishing open-source project.
