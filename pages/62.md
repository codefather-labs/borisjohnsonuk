Why CPython Is Written in C and Not Python Python application twice without changing the source code, it will be faster on the second execution. This is because it loads the compiled bytecode instead of recompiling each time. 
#Why CPython Is Written in C and Not 

 
#Python 

 The  C  in CPython is a reference to the C programming language, implying that this Python distribution is written in the C language. This statement is mostly true: the compiler in CPython is written in pure C. However, many of the standard library modules are written in pure Python or a combination of C and Python. 
##So Why Is the CPython Compiler Written in C 

 
##and Not Python? 

 The answer is located in how compilers work. There are two types of compilers: 1.  Self-hosted compilers  are compilers written in the language they compile, such as the Go compiler. This is done by a process known as bootstrapping. 2.  Source-to-source compilers  are compilers written in another language that already has a compiler. If you’re writing a new programming language from scratch, you need an executable application to compile your compiler! You need a compiler to execute anything, so when new languages are developed, they’re often written ﬁrst in an older, more established language. There are also tools available that can take a language speciﬁcation and create a parser (topics you will cover in this chapter). Popular compiler-compilers include GNU Bison, Yacc, and ANTLR. 62
