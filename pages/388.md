Basic C Syntax Because strings are just arrays of values, they cannot be directly copied or compared. The standard library has the  strcpy()  and  strcmp functions (and their  wchar  cousins) for doing these operations and more. 
##Structs 

 Your ﬁnal stop on this mini-tour of C is how you can create new types in C:  structs . The  struct  keyword allows you to group a set of diﬀerent data types together into a new, custom data type: struct  <struct_name> { <type> <member_name>; <type> <member_name>; ... }; This partial example from  Modules/arraymodule.c  shows a struct declaration: struct  arraydescr { char  typecode; int  itemsize; ... }; This creates a new data type called  struct arraydescr  which has many members, the ﬁrst two of which are a  char typecode  and an  int itemsize . Frequently structs will be used as part of a  typedef  which provides a simple alias for the name. In the example above, all variables of the new type must be declared with the full name  struct arraydescr x; . You’ll frequently see syntax like this: typedef struct  { PyObject_HEAD SEM_HANDLE handle; 388
