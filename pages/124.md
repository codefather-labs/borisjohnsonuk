Future Flags and Compiler Flags from  __future__  import  annotations The code after this statement might use unresolved type hints, so the __future__  statement is required. Otherwise, the module wouldn’t import. 
##Reference of Future Flags in 3.9.0b1 

 As of 3.9.0b1, all but two of the future flags are mandatory and enabled automatically: Import Mandatory Since Purpose nested_- scopes 2.2 Statically nested scopes (PEP227) generators 2.3 Simple generators (PEP255) division 3.0 Use the “true” division operator (PEP238) absolute_- import 3.0 Enable absolute imports (PEP328) with_- statement 2.6 Enable the with statement (PEP343) print_- function 3.0 Make  print  a function (PEP3105) unicode_- literals 3.0 Make  str  literals Unicode instead of bytes (PEP3112) barry_as_- FLUFL N/A Easter Egg (PEP401) generator_- stop 3.7 Enable  StopIteration  inside generators (PEP479) annotations 4.0 Postponed evaluation of type annotations (PEP563) Note Many of the  __future__  flags were used to aid portability between Python 2 and 3. As Python 4.0 approaches, you may see more future flags added. 124
