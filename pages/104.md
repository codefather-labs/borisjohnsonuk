Abstract Syntax Trees Python language features. Before code is compiled, the CST needs to be converted into a higherlevel structure that represents actual Python constructs. The structure is a representation of the CST, called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). As an example, a binary operation in the AST is called a  BinOp  and is deﬁned as a type of expression. It has three components: •  left  - The left-hand part of the operation •  op  - The operator, e.g., +, -, * •  right  - The right-hand part of the expression The AST for  a + 1  can be represented in an AST as: Expr BinOp Name Add Num Left Op Right ASTs are produced by the CPython parser process, but you can also generate them from Python code using the  ast  module in the Standard Library. Before diving into the implementation of the AST, it would be useful to understand what an AST looks like for a simple piece of Python code.
