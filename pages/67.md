The Python Language Speciﬁcation • It can have milk, but it is optional • There are many types of milk you can put into coﬀee, like full fat, skimmed and soy Deﬁned in EBNF, a coﬀee order could look like this: coffee: 'cup' ('espresso')+ ['water'] [milk] milk: 'full-fat' | 'skimmed' | 'soy' In this chapter, grammar is visualized with railroad diagrams. This diagram is the railroad diagram for the coﬀee statement: cup espresso < water full-fat skimmed soy In a railroad diagram, each possible combination must go in a line from left to right. Optional statements can be bypassed, and some statements can be formed as loops. If you search for  with_stmt  in the grammar ﬁle, you can see the deﬁnition: with_stmt: 'with' with_item (',' with_item)* ':' suite with_item: test ['as' expr] Anything in quotes is a string literal, known as a terminal. Terminals are how keywords are recognized. The  with_stmt  is speciﬁed as: 1. Starting with the word  with 2. Followed by a  with_item , which is a  test  and (optionally), the word as , and an expression 3. Following one or many  with_item , each separated by a comma 67
