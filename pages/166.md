Frame Execution The new frame is then returned, and the original frame is not evaluated. The frame is only evaluated when the generator/coroutine/async method is called on to execute its target. Lastly,  _PyEval_EvalFrame()  is called with the new frame. 
#Frame Execution 

 As covered earlier in the compiler and AST chapters, the code object contains a binary encoding of the bytecode to be executed. It also contains a list of variables and a symbol table. The local and global variables are determined at runtime based on how that function, module, or block was called. This information is added to the frame by the  _PyEval_EvalCode()  function. There are other uses of frames, like the coroutine decorator, which dynamically generates a frame with the target as a variable. The public API,  PyEval_EvalFrameEx()  calls the interpreter’s conﬁgured frame evaluation function in the  eval_frame  property. Frame evaluation was  made pluggable in Python 3.7 with PEP 523 . _PyEval_EvalFrameDefault()  is the default function and the only option bundled with CPython. Frames are executed in the main execution loop inside  _PyEval_- EvalFrameDefault() . This central function brings everything together and brings your code to life. It contains decades of optimization since even a single line of code can have a signiﬁcant impact on performance for the whole of CPython. Everything that gets executed in CPython goes through this function. 166
