Reference Counting if  (value == NULL) { format_exc_check_arg(tstate, PyExc_UnboundLocalError, UNBOUNDLOCAL_ERROR_MSG, PyTuple_GetItem(co->co_varnames, oparg)); goto  error; } Py_INCREF(value); PUSH(value); FAST_DISPATCH(); } A  LOAD_FAST  operation is compiled by many AST nodes that have operations. For example, if you were to assign two variables  a  and  b , then create third,  c  from the result of multiplying them: a  =  10 b  =  20 c  =  a  *  b In the third operation,  c = a * b , the right-hand side expression,  a * b , would be assembled into three operations: 1.  LOAD_FAST , resolving the variable  a  and pushing it to the value stack then incrementing the references to  a  by 1 2.  LOAD_FAST , resolving the variable  b  and pushing it to the value stack then incrementing the references to  b  by 1 3.  BINARY_MULTIPLY The binary multiply operator,  BINARY_MULTIPLY  knows that references to the left and right variables in the operation have been loaded to the Ô¨Årst and second positions in the value stack. It is also implied that the LOAD_FAST  operation incremented its reference counters. In the implementation of the  BINARY_MULTIPLY  operation, the references to both  a  ( left ) and  b  ( right ) are decremented once the result has been calculated. 212
