The CPython Memory Allocator • Just like seats can either be Premium, Regular or Economy, blocks are all of a range of ﬁxed sizes. You can’t bring your deckchair • Just like seats of the same size are put into rows, blocks of the same size are put into sized pools • A central register keeps a record of where blocks are and the number of blocks available in a pool, just as the stadium would allocate seating • When a row in the stadium is full, the next row is used. When a pool of blocks is full, the next pool is used • Pools are grouped into arenas, just like the stadium groups the rows into sections There are some advantages to this strategy: 1. The algorithm is more performant for CPython’s main use caseshort-lived, small objects 2. The algorithm uses the GIL instead of system thread lock detection 3. The algorithm uses memory mapping (mmap) instead of heap allocation
