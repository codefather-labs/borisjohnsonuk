Setting up Your Development Environment Throughout this book, you’ll be working with C and Python code. It’s going to be essential to have your development environment conﬁgured to support both languages. The CPython source code is about 65% Python (the tests are a signiﬁcant part), 24% C, and the remainder a mix of other languages. 
#IDE or Editor? 

 If you haven’t yet decided which development environment to use, there is one decision to make ﬁrst, whether to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or code editor. • An  IDE  targets a speciﬁc language and toolchain. Most IDEs have integrated testing, syntax checking, version control, and compilation. • A  code editor  enables you to edit code ﬁles, regardless of language. Most code editors are simple text editors with syntax highlighting. Because of their full-featured nature, IDEs often consume more hardware resources. So if you have limited RAM (less than 8GB), a code editor is recommended. IDEs also take longer to start-up. If you want to edit a ﬁle quickly, a code editor is a better choice. 24
