Compiling CPython on macOS $ brew install openssl xz zlib gdbm sqlite Now that you have the dependencies, you can run the  configure  script. Homebrew has a command  brew --prefix [package]  that will give the directory where the package is installed. You will enable support for SSL by compiling the location that Homebrew uses. The flag  --with-pydebug  enables debug hooks. Add this if you intend on debugging for development or testing purposes. Debugging CPython is covered extensively in the Debugging chapter. The conﬁguration stage only needs to be run once, also specifying the location of the zlib package: $ CPPFLAGS="-I$(brew --prefix zlib)/include" \ LDFLAGS="-L$(brew --prefix zlib)/lib" \ ./configure --with-openssl=$(brew --prefix openssl) --with-pydebug Running  configure  will generate a  Makefile  in the root of the repository that you can use to automate the build process. You can now build the CPython binary by running: $ make -j2 -s See Also For more help on the options for  make , see section A Quick Primer on Make. During the build, you may receive some errors. In the build the summary,  make  will notify you that not all packages were built. For example,  ossaudiodev ,  spwd , and  _tkinter  would fail to build with this set of instructions. That’s okay if you aren’t planning on developing against those packages. If you are, then check out the  oﬃcial dev guide  website for more information. The build will take a few minutes and generate a binary called python.exe . Every time you make changes to the source code, you will 45
