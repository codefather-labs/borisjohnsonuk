Objects and Types CPython comes with a collection of basic types like strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and objects. All of these types are built-in. You don’t need to import any libraries, even from the standard library. For example, to create a new list, you can call: lst  =  list() Or, you can use square brackets: lst  =  [] Strings can be instantiated from a string-literal by using either double or single quotes. You explored the grammar deﬁnitions in the chapter “The Python Language and Grammar” that cause the compiler to interpret double quotes as a string literal. All types in Python inherit from  object , a built-in base type. Even strings, tuples, and lists inherit from  object . In  Objects object.c , the base implementation of  object  type is written as pure C code. There are some concrete implementations of basic logic, like shallow comparisons. A simple way to think of a Python object is consisting of 2 things: 1. The core data model, with pointers to compiled functions 288
