#Reference Counting 

 As you have explored so far in this chapter, CPython is built on C’s Dynamic Memory Allocation system. Memory requirements are determined at runtime, and memory is allocated on the system using the  PyMem  APIs. For the Python developer, this system has been abstracted and simpliﬁed. Developers don’t have to worry (too much) about allocating and free’ing memory. To achieve simple memory management, Python adopts two strategies for managing the memory allocated by objects: 1. Reference Counting 2. Garbage Collection 
##Creating Variables in Python 

 To create a variable in Python, you have to assign a value to a  uniquely named variable. For example: my_variable  =  [ 'a' ,  'b' ,  'c' ] When a  value  is assigned to a  variable  in Python, the  name  of the variable is checked within the locals and globals scope to see if it already exists. In the example,  my_variable  is not already within any  locals()  or globals()  dictionary. A new  list  object is created, and a pointer is stored in the  locals()  dictionary. There is now one  reference  to my_variable . The list object’s memory should not be freed while there are valid references to it. If memory were freed, the  my_variable 207
