Constructing Frame Objects •  _co :  a  PyCodeObject*  containing the code to be put into the frame object •  globals :  a  PyObject*  ( dict ) with variable names as keys and their values •  locals :  a  PyObject*  ( dict ) with variable names as keys and their values Note In Python, local and global variables stored as a dictionary. You can access this dictionary with the builtin functions  locals() and  globals() : >>>  a  =  1 >>>  print(locals()[ 'a' ]) 1 The other arguments are optional, and not used for the basic API: •  args :  a  PyObject*  ( tuple ) with positional argument values in order, and  argcount  for the number of values •  kwnames :  a list of keyword argument names •  kwargs :  a list of keyword argument values, and  kwcount  for the number of them •  defs :  a list of default values for positional arguments, and  defcount for the length •  kwdefs :  a dictionary with the default values for keyword arguments •  closure :  a tuple with strings to merge into the code objects  co_- freevars  ﬁeld •  name :  the name for this evaluation statement as a string •  qualname :  the qualiﬁed name for this evaluation statement as a string The call to  _PyFrame_New_NoTrack()  creates a new frame.
