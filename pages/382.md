Basic C Syntax 
##General 

 Unlike in Python, whitespace is not important to the C compiler. It does not care if you split statements across lines or jam your entire program onto a single, very long line. This is because it uses delimiters for all statements and blocks. There are, of course, very speciﬁc rules for the parser, but in general you’ll understand the CPython source just knowing that each statement ends with a semicolon ( ; ) and all blocks of code are surrounded by curly braces ( {} ). The exception to this rule is that if a block has only a single statement, the curly braces can be omitted. All variables in C must be  declared  meaning there needs to be a single statement giving the  type  of that variable. Note that, unlike Python, the data type that a single variable can hold cannot change. Let’s look at some examples: /* comments are included between slash-asterisk and asterisk-slash */ /* This style of comment can span several lines - so this part is still a comment. */ // OR comments can be after two slashes // This type of comments only go until the end of the line, so new // lines must have //s again. int  x =  0 ;  // declares x to be of type 'int' and initializes it to 0 if  (x ==  0 ) { // this is a block of code int  y =  1 ; // y is only a valid variable name until the closing } // more statements here printf( "x is %d y is %dn" , x, y); } // single line blocks do not require curly brackets 382
