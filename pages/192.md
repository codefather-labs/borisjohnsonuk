The CPython Memory Allocator Field Type Purpose freepools pool_header* Singly-linked list of available pools nextarena arena_- object* Next arena (see note) prevarena arena_- object* Previous arena (see note) Note Arenas are linked together in a doubly-linked list inside the arena data structure, using the  nextarena  and  prevarena  pointers. If this arena is  unallocated , the  nextarena  member is used. The nextarena  member links all unassociated arenas in the singlylinked  unused_arena_objects  global variable. When this arena is associated with an allocated arena, with at least one available pool, both  nextarena  and  prevarena  are used in the doubly-linked  usable_arenas  list. This list is maintained in increasing order of  nfreepools  values. 192
