Generators } ... return  gen; } ... The generator factory,  PyGen_NewWithQualName() , takes the frame and completes some steps to populate the generator object ﬁelds: 1. Sets the  gi_code  property to the compiled code object 2. Sets the generator to not running ( gi_running = 0 ) 3. Sets the exception and weakref lists to  NULL You can also see that  gi_code  is the compiled code object for the generator function by importing the  dis  module and disassembling the bytecode inside: >>>  from  letter_generator  import  letters >>>  gen  =  letters() >>>  import  dis >>>  dis.disco(gen.gi_code) 2 0  LOAD_CONST 1  ( 97 ) 2  STORE_FAST 0  (i) ... In the chapter on the Evaluation Loop, you explored the Frame Object Type. Frame objects contain locals and globals, the last executed instructions, and the code to be executed. The builtin behavior and state of the frame object are how generators can  pause  and be  resumed  on demand. 
##Executing Generators 

 Whenever  __next__()  is called on a generator object,  gen_iternext()  is called with the generator instance, which immediately calls  gen_send_- ex()  inside  Objects genobject.c . 273
