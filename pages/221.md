Garbage Collection the criteria in (2) to it. 4. Remove every object that met the criteria in (2) from the generation list. There is no single method for determining cyclical references. Each type must deﬁne a custom function with signature  traverseproc  in the tp_traverse  slot. To complete task (2), the  deduce_unreachable()  function will call the traversal function for every object within a  subtract_- refs()  function. It is expected that the traversal function will run the callback  visit_- decref()  for every item it contains: Modules gcmodule.c  line 462 static void subtract_refs(PyGC_Head *containers) { traverseproc traverse; PyGC_Head *gc = GC_NEXT(containers); for  (; gc != containers; gc = GC_NEXT(gc)) { PyObject *op = FROM_GC(gc); traverse = Py_TYPE(op)->tp_traverse; ( void ) traverse(FROM_GC(gc), (visitproc)visit_decref, op); } } The traversal functions are kept within each object’s source code in Objects . For example, the  tuple  type’s traversal,  tupletraverse()  calls visit_decref()  on all of it’s items. The dictionary type, will call  visit_- decref()  on all keys and values. Any object which did not end up being moved to the  unreachable  list graduates to the next generation. 221
