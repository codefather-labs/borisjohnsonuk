#Example: Adding an Item to a List 

 In Python, when you create a list, the  .append()  method is available on the list object: my_list  =  [] my_list.append(obj) In this example,  obj  is an object that you want to append to the end of the list. There are 2 operations involved in this operation: •  LOAD_FAST , to load the object  obj  to the top of the value stack from the list of  locals  in the frame •  LIST_APPEND  to add the object First exploring  LOAD_FAST , there are 5 steps: 1. The pointer to  obj  is loaded from  GETLOCAL() , where the variable to load is the operation argument. The list of variable pointers is stored in  fastlocals , which is a copy of the PyFrame attribute  f_- localsplus . The operation argument is a number, pointing to the index in the  fastlocals  array pointer. This means that the loading of a local is simply a copy of the pointer instead of having to look up the variable name. 2. If the variable no longer exists, an unbound local variable error is raised. 3. The reference counter for  value  (in our case,  obj ) is increased by 1. 4. The pointer to  obj  is pushed to the top of the value stack. 5. The  FAST_DISPATCH  macro is called, if tracing is enabled, the loop goes over again (with all the tracing). If tracing is not enabled, a goto  is called to  fast_next_opcode . The  goto  jumps back to the top of the loop for the next instruction. 175
