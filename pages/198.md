The Object and PyMem Memory Allocation Domains 
##Using the Python Debug API 

 The  sys  module contains an internal function,  _debugmallocstats() , to get the number of blocks in use for each of the class size pools. It will also print the number of arenas allocated, reclaimed, and the total number of blocks used. You can use this function to see the running memory usage: $ ./python -c "import sys; sys._debugmallocstats()" Small block threshold = 512, in 32 size classes. class size num pools blocks in use avail blocks --------------------------------------- 0 16 1 181 72 1 32 6 675 81 2 48 18 1441 71 ... 2 free 18-sized PyTupleObjects * 168 bytes each = 336 3 free 19-sized PyTupleObjects * 176 bytes each = 528 The output shows the class index size table, the allocations, and some additional statistics.

#Allocation Domains 

 CPython’s object memory allocator is the ﬁrst of the three domains that you will explore. The purpose of the Object memory allocator is to allocate memory related to Python Objects, such as: • New Object Headers • Object data, such as dictionary keys and values, or list items The allocator is also used for the compiler, AST, parser and evaluation 198
