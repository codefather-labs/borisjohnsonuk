Unicode String Type A  big-endian  ordering places the most signiﬁcant byte ﬁrst. A  littleendian  ordering places the least signiﬁcant byte ﬁrst. The UTF8 speciﬁcation does support a BOM, but it has no eﬀect. The UTF8 BOM can appear at the beginning of a UTF8-encoded data sequence, represented as  b'\xef\xbb\xbf' , and will indicate to CPython that the data stream is most-likely UTF8. UTF16 and UTF32 support little and big-endian BOMs. The default byte-order in CPython is set by the  sys.byteorder  global value: >>>  import  sys ;  print(sys.byteorder) little 
##The Encodings Package 

 The encodings package in  Lib encodings  comes with over 100 builtin supported encodings for CPython. Whenever the  .encode()  or  .decode()  method is called on a string or byte string, the encoding is looked up from this package. Each encoding is deﬁned as a separate module, e.g.,  ISO2022_JP , a widely used encoding for Japanese email systems, is declared in  Lib encodings iso2022_jp.py . Every encoding module will deﬁne a function  getregentry()  and register: • Its unique name • Its encode and decode functions from a codec module • Its incremental encoder and decoder classes • Its stream reader and stream writer classes Many of the encoding modules share the same codecs either from the codecs  module, or the  _mulitbytecodec  module. Some encoding modules use a separate codec module in C, from  Modules _codecs . 306
