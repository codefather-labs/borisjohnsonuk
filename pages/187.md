Design of the Python Memory Management System dynamic. The user never has to specify the size of these types 3. Names in Python can be reused to values of diﬀerent types, e.g.: >>>  a_value  =  1 >>>  a_value  =  "Now I'm a string" >>>  a_value  =  [ "Now"  ,  "I'm" "a" ,  "list" ] To overcome these constraints, CPython relies heavily on dynamic memory allocation but adds safety-rails to automate the freeing of memory using the garbage collection and reference counting algorithms. Instead of the Python developer having to allocate memory, Python Object memory is allocated automatically via a single, uniﬁed API. This design requires that the entire CPython standard library and core modules (written in C) use this API. 
##Allocation Domains 

 CPython comes with three dynamic memory allocation domains: 1.  Raw Domain  - Used for allocation from the system heap. Used for large, or non-object related memory allocation 2.  Object Domain  - Used for allocation of all Python Object-related memory allocation 3.  PyMem Domain  - The same as  PYMEM_DOMAIN_OBJ , exists for legacy API purposes Each domain implements the same interface of functions: •  _Alloc(size_t size)  - allocates memory of size,  size , and returns a pointer •  _Calloc(size_t nelem, size_t elsize)  - allocates memory of size •  _Realloc(void *ptr, size_t new_size)  - reallocates memory to a new size 187
