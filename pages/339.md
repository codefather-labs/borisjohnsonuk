Using Gdb (gdb) run my_script.py 
##Attaching to a Running CPython Interpreter 

 If you have a CPython interpreter running already, you can attach to it. From inside the gdb session, run  attach  with the process id: (gdb) attach 123 You can get the process ID from the Activity Monitor, or using os.getpid()  in Python. Any breakpoints setup before this point or afterward will halt the process. 
##Handling a Breakpoint 

 When a breakpoint is hit, you can use the  print , or  p  command to print a variable: (gdb) p *(PyLongObject*)v $1 = {ob_base = {ob_base = {ob_refcnt = 8, ob_type = ...}, ob_size = 1}, ob_digit = {42}} To step into the next statement, use the command  step , or  s . To step over the next statement, use the command  next , or  n . 
##Using the Python-Gdb Extension 

 The python-gdb extension will load an additional command set into the gdb console: Command Purpose py-print Looks up a Python variable and prints it py-bt Prints a Python stack trace py-locals Prints the result of  locals() py-up Go down one Python frame 339
