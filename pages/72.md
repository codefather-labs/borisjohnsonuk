Regenerating Grammar In the REPL, you can now try deﬁning a function. Instead of using the pass  statement, use the  proceed  keyword alternative that you compiled into the Python grammar: $ ./python -X oldparser Python 3.9.0b1 (tags/v3.9.0b1:97fe9cf, May 19 2020, 10:00:00) [Clang 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.46.4)] on darwin Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information. >>> def example(): ... proceed ... >>> example() Congratulations, you’ve changed the CPython syntax and compiled your own version of CPython. Next, we’ll explore tokens and their relationship to grammar. 
##Tokens 

 Alongside the grammar ﬁle in the  Grammar  folder is the  Grammar Tokens ﬁle, which contains each of the unique types found as leaf nodes in a parse tree. Each token also has a name and a generated unique ID. The names are used to make it simpler to refer to in the tokenizer. Note The  Grammar Tokens  ﬁle is a new feature in Python 3.8. For example, the left parenthesis is called  LPAR , and semicolons are called  SEMI . You’ll see these tokens later in the book: LPAR '(' RPAR ')' LSQB '[' RSQB ']' COLON ':' 72
