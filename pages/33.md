Setting up JetBrains CLion compiling CPython. 
#Setting up JetBrains CLion 

 JetBrains make an IDE for Python, called PyCharm, as well as an IDE for C/C++ development called CLion. CPython has both C and Python code. You cannot install C/C++ support into PyCharm, but CLion comes bundled with Python support. To setup CPython in CLion, install the following plugins: •  Makeﬁle support CLion is fully integrated with the CMake system. However, CPython uses  GNU Make . CLion will give an error saying it cannot locate a CMakeLists.txt  ﬁle when you open the CPython source code directory. There is a workaround to create a  compile_commands.json  ﬁle from the compilation steps inside the CPython Makeﬁle. Important This step assumes you can compile CPython, please read Compiling CPython for your Operating System and return to this chapter. We need to create a “Compile Database” using a utility called  compiledb . At the command line, within the CPython repository: $ pip install compiledb $ compiledb make Then open CLion and open the  compile_commands.json  ﬁle, you will be asked to open ﬁle or “Open as Project,” select   Open as Project  : 33
