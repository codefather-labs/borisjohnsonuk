1  When they become available! At the time of writing, the only available references for Asyncio were the API specification in the official Python documentation and a collection of blog posts, several of which have been linked to in this book.

 It is my hope that this book can help you distinguish between the features of Asyncio that are important for end-user developers and those important for framework developers. If you’re interested in the lower-level details around how concurrency frameworks like Asyncio are built internally, I highly recommend a wonderful talk by Dave Beazley,  “Python Concurrency from the Ground Up: LIVE!” , in which he demonstrates putting together a simpler version of an async framework like Asyncio. My goal is to give you only the most basic understanding of the building blocks of Asyncio—enough that you should be able to write simple programs with it, and certainly enough that you will be able to dive into more complete references. 1 First up, we have a “quickstart” section that introduces the most important building blocks for Asyncio applications. ### Quickstart
 You only need to know about seven functions to use Asyncio [for everyday use]. —Yury Selivanov, author of PEP 492, which added the  `async`  and  `await`  keywords to Python It’s pretty scary diving into the  official documentation  for Asyncio. There are many sections with new, enigmatic words and concepts that will be unfamiliar to even experienced Python programmers, as Asyncio is a very new thing in Python. I’m going to break all that down and explain how to approach the  `asyncio`  module documentation later, but for now you need to know that the actual surface area you have to worry about with the  `asyncio`  library is much smaller than it seems. Yury Selivanov, the author of  PEP 492  and all-round major contributor to async Python, explained in his PyCon 2016 talk  “async/await in Python 3.5 and Why It Is Awesome,”  that many of the APIs in the  `asyncio`  module are really intended for framework designers, not end-user developers. In that talk, he emphasized the main features that end users should care about. These are a small subset of the whole `asyncio`  API and can be summarized as follows: •  Starting the  `asyncio`  event loop •  Calling  `async` / `await`  functions **22 ** **| ** **Chapter 3: Asyncio Walk-Through**
