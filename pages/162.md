Constructing Frame Objects Converting Keyword Parameters to a Dictionary Function deﬁnitions can contain a  **kwargs  catch-all for keywordarguments, for example: def  example(arg, arg2 = None ,  ** kwargs): print(kwargs[ 'x' ], kwargs[ 'y' ]) # this would resolve to a dictionary key example( 1 , x = 2 , y = 3 ) # 2 3 In this scenario, a new dictionary is created, and the unresolved arguments are copied across. The  kwargs  name is then set as a variable in the local scope of the frame. Converting Positional Arguments Into Variables Each of the positional arguments (if provided) are set as local variables: In Python, function arguments are already local variables within the function body. When a positional argument is deﬁned with a value, it is available within the function scope: def  example(arg1, arg2): print(arg1, arg2) example( 1 ,  2 ) # 1 2 The reference counter for those variables is incremented, so the garbage collector won’t remove them until the frame has evaluated (e.g. the function has ﬁnished and returned). Packing Positional Arguments Into  *args Similar to  **kwargs , a function argument prepended with a  *  can be set to catch all remaining positional arguments. This argument is a tuple and the  *args  name is set as a local variable: def  example(arg,  * args): print(arg, args[ 0 ], args[ 1 ]) example( 1 ,  2 ,  3 ) # 1 2 3 162
