Generators The following systems are still available: • Creating futures from  async  keywords • Coroutines using the  yield from  keywords 
#Generators 

 Python Generators are functions that return a  yield  statement and can be called continually to generate further values. Generators are often used as a more memory eﬃcient way of looping through values in a large block of data, like a ﬁle, a database, or over a network. Generator objects are returned in place of a  value  when yield  is used instead of  return . The generator object is created from the  yield  statement and returned to the caller. This simple generator function will yield the letters a-z: cpython-book-samples 33 letter_generator.py def  letters(): i  =  97 # letter 'a' in ASCII end  =  97  +  26 # letter 'z' in ASCII while  i  <  end: yield  chr(i) i  +=  1 If you call  letters() , it won’t return a value, but instead it returns a generator object: >>>  from  letter_generator  import  letters >>>  letters() < generator object letters at  0x1004d39b0 > Built into the syntax of the  for  statement is the ability to iterate through a generator object until it stops yielding values: 269
