The CPython Memory Allocator Pools are allocated on demand. When no available pools are available for the requested class size index, a new one is provisioned. Arenas have a “high water mark” to index how many pools have been provisioned. Pools have three possible states, 1.  Full : all available blocks in that pool are allocated 2.  Used : the pool is allocated, and some blocks have been set, but it still has space 3.  Empty : the pool is allocated, but no blocks have been set Arena Full Full Full Highwater mark Full Full Full Full Full Used Used Used Used Used Used Used Used Used Used Used Used Empty Empty Empty Empty 0 2 3 4 2 8 8 2 Class:Status 1 5 3 8 10 2 2 1 0 4 5 7 9 2 10 1 Unallocated Pool Area Pools have the data structure  poolp , which is a static allocation of the struct  pool_header . The  pool_header  type has the following properties: Field Type Purpose ref uint Number of currently allocated blocks in this pool freeblock block * Pointer to this pool’s “free list” head nextpool pool_header* Pointer to the next pool of this size class prevpool pool_header* Pointer to the previous pool of this size class arenaindex uint Singly-linked list of available pools szidx uint Class size index of this pool nextoffset uint Number of bytes to unused block maxnextoffset uint Maximum number that  nextoffset  can be until pool is full Each pool of a certain class size will keep a doubly-linked list to the 194
