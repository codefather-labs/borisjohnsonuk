Assembly Field Type Purpose b_next basicblock* If  b_next  is non- NULL , it is a pointer to the next block reached by normal control flow b_seen unsigned Used to perform a DFS of basicblocks. See assembly b_return unsigned Is true if block returns a value (a  RETURN_VALUE opcode is inserted) b_- startdepth int Depth of stack upon entry of block, computed by  stackdepth() b_offset int Instruction oﬀset for block, computed by assemble_jump_offsets() 
##Operations and Arguments 

 Depending on the type of operation, there are diﬀerent arguments required. For example,  ADDOP_JABS  and  ADDOP_JREL  refer to “ ADD O peration with  J ump to a  REL ative position” and “ ADD O peration with  J ump to an  ABS olute position”. The  ADDOP_JREL  and  ADDOP_JABS macros which call  compiler_addop_j(struct compiler *c, int opcode, basicblock *b, int absolute)  and set the  absolute  argument to 0 and 1 respectively. There are some other macros, like  ADDOP_I  calls  compiler_addop_i() which add an operation with an integer argument, or  ADDOP_O  calls compiler_addop_o()  which adds an operation with a  PyObject  argument. 
#Assembly 

 Once these compilation stages have completed, the compiler has a list of frame blocks, each containing a list of instructions and a pointer to the next block. The assembler performs a “depth-ﬁrst-search” of the basic frame blocks and merges the instructions into a single bytecode sequence. 
##Assembler Data Structure 

 The assembler state struct,  assembler , is declared in  Python compile.c . 138
