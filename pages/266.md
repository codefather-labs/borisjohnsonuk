Boot State Thread  bootstate  has the properties: Field Type Purpose interp PyInterpreterState* Link to the interpreter managing this thread func PyObject * ( callable ) Link to the  callable  to execute upon running the thread args PyObject *  ( tuple ) Arguments to call  func  with keyw PyObject *  ( dict ) Keyword arguments to call  func  with tstate PyThreadState * Thread state for the new thread With the thread bootstate, there are two implementations  PyThread  POSIX threads for Linux and macOS, and NT threads for Windows. Both of these implementations create the Operating System thread, set itâ€™s attribute and then execute the callback  t_bootstrap()  from within the new thread. This function is called with the single argument  boot_raw , assigned to the bootstate constructed in  thread_- PyThread_start_new_thread() . The  t_bootstrap()  function is the interface between a low-level thread and the Python runtime. The bootstrap will initiatilize the thread, then execute the  target  callable using  PyObject_Call() . Once the callable target has been executed, the thread will exit: 266
