Execution Parser AST Bytecode Compiler Assembler CFG Important Throughout this chapter, it is important to remember that the unit of compilation for CPython is a module. The compilation steps and process indicated in this chapter will happen once for each module in your project. In this chapter, you will focus on the compilation of an AST module into a code object: PyRun_FileExFlags() PyParser_ASTFromFileObject() File Pointer PyAST_CompileObject() run_eval_code() AST Module Code Object Return Value The  PyAST_CompileObject()  function is the main entry point to the CPython compiler.
