Introduction Are there certain parts of Python that just seem magic? Like how dictionaries are so much faster than looping over a list to ﬁnd an item. How does a generator remember the state of the variables each time it yields a value, and why do you never have to allocate memory like other languages? It turns out, CPython, the most popular Python runtime is written in human-readable C and Python code. CPython abstracts the complexities of the underlying C platform and your Operating System. It makes threading cross-platform and straightfoward. It takes the pain of memory management in C and makes it simple. CPython gives the developer writing Python code the platform to write scalable and performant applications. At some stage in your progression as a Python developer, you need to understand how CPython works. These abstractions are not perfect, and they are leaky. Once you understand how CPython works, you can optimize your applications and fully leverage its power. This book will explain the concepts, ideas, and technicalities of CPython. In this book you’ll cover the major concepts behind the internals of CPython, and learn how to: • Read and navigate the source code • Compile CPython from source code • Make changes to the Python syntax and compile them into your version of CPython 15
