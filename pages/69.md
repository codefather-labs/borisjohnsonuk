Using the Parser Generator The  try  statement is a good example of a more complex structure. If you want to understand the Python language in detail, the grammar is deﬁned in  Grammar Grammar . 
#Using the Parser Generator 

 The grammar ﬁle itself is never used by the Python compiler. Instead, a parser table is created by a parser generator. If you make changes to the grammar ﬁle, you must regenerate the parser table and recompile CPython. Parser Tables are a list of potential parser states. When parse trees become complex, they ensure that grammar cannot be ambiguous. 
#The Parser Generator 

 A parser generator works by converting the EBNF statements into a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA). The NFA states and transitions are resolved and consolidated into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA). The DFAs are used by the parser as parsing tables. This technique was formed at Stanford University  and developed in the 1980s, just before the advent of Python. CPython’s parser generator,  pgen , is unique to the CPython project. The  pgen  application is was rewritten in Python 3.8 from C to Python as  Parser pgen pgen.py . It is executed as : $ ./python -m Parser.pgen [grammar] [tokens] [graminit.h] [graminit.c] It is normally executed from the build scripts, not directly. The DFA and NFA don’t have a visual output, but  there is a branch of CPython  with a directed graph output.  decorator  grammar is deﬁned 69
