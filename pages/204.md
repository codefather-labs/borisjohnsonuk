Custom Memory Allocation Sanitizers that require speciﬁc stability constraints, very high security, or for debugging memory allocation bugs. CPython can be compiled using several memory sanitizers. These are part of the compiler libraries, not something developed for CPython. They typically slow down CPython signiﬁcantly and cannot be combined. They generally are for use in debugging scenarios or systems where preventing corrupt memory access is critical. 
##Address Sanitizer 

 Address Sanitizer is a “fast” memory error detector. It can detect many runtime memory-related bugs: • Out-of-bounds accesses to heap, stack, and globals • Memory being used after it has been freed • Double-free, invalid free It can be enabled by running: $ ./configure --with-address-sanitizer ... Important Address Sanitizer would slow down applications by up to 2x and consume up to 3x more memory. Address Sanitizer is supported on: • Linux • macOS • NetBSD • FreeBSD See the oﬃcial documentation for more information . 204
