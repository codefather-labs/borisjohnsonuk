Dictionary Type >>>  "hello"  ~=  "HEllO" True >>>  "hello?"  ~=  "hello" False 
#Dictionary Type 

 Dictionaries are a fast and flexible mapping type. They are used by developers to store and map data, as well as by Python objects to store properties and methods. Python dictionaries are also used for local and global variables, for keyword arguments and many other use cases. Python dictionaries are  compact , meaning the hash table only stores mapped values. The hashing algorithm that is part of all immutable builtin types is fast, and what gives Python dictionaries their speed. 
##Hashing 

 All immutable builtin types provide a hashing function. This is deﬁned in the  tp_hash  type slot, or using the  __hash__()  magic-method for custom types. Hash values are the same size as a pointer (64-bit for 64-bit systems, 32 for 32-bit systems), but do not represent the memory address of their values. The resulting hash for any Python Object should not change during it’s lifecycle. Hashes for two immutable instances with identical values should be equal: >>>  "hello" . __hash__ ()  ==  ( "hel"  +  "lo" ). __hash__ () True There should be no hash collissions, two objects with diﬀerent values should not produce the same hash. 311
