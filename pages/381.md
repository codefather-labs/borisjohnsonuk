Basic C Syntax There are three basic forms of  #if  that you’ll see in the CPython source: •  #ifdef <macro>  :  includes the following block of text if the speciﬁed macro is deﬁned •  #if defined(<macro>) :  same as  #ifdef •  #ifundef <macro> :  includes the following block of text if the speciﬁed macro is not deﬁned •  #if <macro> :  includes the following text if the macro is deﬁned  and it evaluates to True Note the use of “text” instead of “code” to describe what is included or excluded from the ﬁle. The preprocessor knows nothing of C syntax and does not care what the speciﬁed text is. #pragma Pragmas are instructions or hints to the compiler. In general you can ignore these while reading the code as they usually deal with how the code is compiled, not how the code runs. #error Finally,  #error  displays a message and causes the preprocessor to stop executing. Again, you can safely ignore these for reading the CPython source code.

 This section will not cover ALL aspects of C nor, again, is it intended to teach you how to write C. It will focus on things that are diﬀerent or confusing for Python developers the ﬁrst time they see them. 381
