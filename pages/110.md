Abstract Syntax Trees struct  { asdl_seq *argtypes; expr_ty returns; } FunctionType; struct  { asdl_seq *body; } Suite; } v; }; The C header ﬁle and structures are there so that the  Python ast.c  program can quickly generate the structures with pointers to the relevant data. The AST entry-point,  PyAST_FromNodeObject() , is essentially a  switch statement around the result from  TYPE(n) .  TYPE()  is a macro used by the AST to determine what type a node in the concrete syntax tree is. The result of  TYPE()  will be either a symbol or token type. By starting at the root node, it can only be one of the module types deﬁned as Module ,  Interactive ,  Expression ,  FunctionType . • For  file_input , the type should be a  Module • For  eval_input , such as from a REPL, the type should be an Expression For each type of statement, there is a corresponding  ast_for_xxx  C function in  Python ast.c , which will look at the CST nodes to complete the properties for that statement. One of the simpler examples is the power expression, i.e.,  2**4  is 2 to the power of 4. The  ast_for_power()  function will return a  BinOp  (binary operation) with the operator as  Pow  (power), the left hand of  e  (2), and the right hand of  f  (4): 110
