“What impresses me the most about Anthony’s book is how it puts all the steps for making changes to the CPython code base in an easy to follow sequence. It really feels like a ‘missing manual’ of sorts. Diving into the C underpinnings of Python was a lot of fun and it cleared up some longstanding questions marks for me. I found the chapter about CPython’s memory allocator especially enlightening. CPython Internals is a great (and unique) resource for anybody looking to take their knowledge of Python to a deeper level.” —  Dan Bader , Author of  Python Tricks  and Editor-in-Chief at Real Python “This book helped me to better understand how lexing and parsing works in Python. It’s my recommended source if you want to understand it.” —  Florian Dahlitz , Pythonista
