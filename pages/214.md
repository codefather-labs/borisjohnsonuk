Garbage Collection The reference count for  x  is still 1 because it referred to itself. To cater to this complexity, and resolve some of these memory leaks, CPython has a second memory management mechanism,  Garbage Collection . 
#Garbage Collection 

 How often does your garbage get collected? Weekly or fortnightly? When you’re ﬁnished with something, you discard it and throw it in the trash. But that trash won’t get collected straight away. You need to wait for the garbage trucks to come and pick it up. CPython has the same principle, using a garbage collection algorithm. CPython’s garbage collector is  enabled  by default, happens in the background, and works to deallocate memory that’s been used for objects which no longer exist. Because the garbage collection algorithm is a lot more complicated than the reference counter, it doesn’t happen all the time. If it did, it would consume a vast amount of CPU resources. The garbage collection runs periodically after a set number of operations.

 As you uncovered in the previous section, every Python object retains a counter of the number of references to it. Once that counter reaches 214
