Conclusion f  =  f.f_back The parent’s parent ( sys._getframe().f_back.f_back ) is set as the frame, because you don’t want to see the call to  walk_stack()  or  print_trace() in the traceback. The  f_back  pointer is followed to the top of the call stack. sys._getframe()  is the Python API to get the  frame  attribute of the current thread. Here is how that frame stack would look visually, with 3 frames each with its code object and a thread state pointing to the current frame: FRAME 0 FRAME 1 FRAME 2 Code Object Code Object Code Object f_back f_back Thread State frame 
#Conclusion 

 In this chapter, you’ve been introduced to the “brain” of CPython. The core evaluation loop is the interface between compiled Python code and the underlying C extension modules, libraries, and system calls. Some parts in this chapter have been glossed over as you’ll go into them in upcoming chapters. For example, the CPython interpreter has a core evaluation loop, you can have multiple loops running at the same time. Whether that be in parallel or concurrently. CPython can have multiple evaluation loops running multiple frames on a system. In an upcoming chapter on Parallelism and Concurrency, you will see 180
