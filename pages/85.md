Conﬁguration State 
##Setting Runtime Con�guration with the 

 
##Command Line 

 Python also comes with several  Command Line Interface Options . As an example, CPython has a mode called  verbose mode . This is primarily aimed at developers for debugging CPython. In Python you can enable verbose mode with the  -v  flag. In verbose mode, Python will print messages to the screen when modules are loaded: $ ./python -v -c "print('hello world')" # installing zipimport hook import zipimport # builtin # installed zipimport hook ... You will see a hundred lines or more with all the imports of your user site-packages and anything else in the system environment. Because runtime conﬁguration can be set in several ways, conﬁguration settings have levels of precedence over each other. The order of precedence for verbose mode is: 1. The default value for  config->verbose  is hardcoded to  -1  in the source code. 2. The environment variable  PYTHONVERBOSE  is used to set the value of config->verbose . 3. If the environment variable does not exist, then the default value of  -1  will remain. 4. In  config_parse_cmdline()  within  Python initconfig.c , the command line flag is used to set the value, if provided. 5. This value is copied to a global variable,  Py_VerboseFlag  by  _Py_- GetGlobalVariablesAsDict() . All  PyConfig  values follow the same sequence and order of precedence: 85
