 With your help we can make this book even better: At the end of each section of the book you’ll ﬁnd a “magical” feedback link. Clicking the link takes you to an  online feedback form  where you can share your thoughts with us. Please feel free to be as terse or detailed as you see ﬁt. All feedback is stored anonymously, but you can choose to leave your name and contact information so we can follow up or mention you on our “Thank You” page. We use a diﬀerent feedback link for each section, so we’ll always know which part of the book your notes refer to. Thank you for helping us make this book an even more valuable learning resource for the Python community. — Anthony Shaw
