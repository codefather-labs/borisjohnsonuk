Conclusion Congratulations! You’ve made it to all the way to the end of this book. There are three main uses of the knowledge you’ve learned: 1. Writing C extensions 2. Improving your Python applications 3. Contributing to the CPython Project As a conclusion and summary of the topics, lets explore those. 
#Writing C Extensions for CPython 

 There are several ways in which you can extend the functionality of Python. One of these is to write your Python module in C or C++. This process can lead to improved performance and better access to C library functions and system calls. If you want to write a C extension module, there are some essential things you’ll need to know that this book has prepared you for: • How to set up a C compiler and compile C modules. See the chapter on Compiling CPython. • How to set up your development environment for C. See the Setting up Your Development Environment chapter. • How to increment and decrement references to generated objects. See Reference Counting in the Memory Management chapter. 371
