##Starting Threads in Python 

 To demonstrate the performance gains of having multithreaded code (in spite of the GIL), you can implement a simple network port scanner in Python. Now clone the previous script but change the logic to spawn a thread for each port using  threading.Thread() . This is similar to the multiprocessing  API, where it takes a callable,  target , and a tuple,  args . Start the threads inside the loop, but donâ€™t wait for them to complete. Instead, append the thread instance to a list,  threads : for  port  in  range( 800 ,  100 ): t  =  Thread(target = check_port, args = (host, port, results)) t.start() threads.append(t) Once all threads have been created, iterate through the thread list and call  .join()  to wait for them to complete: for  t  in  threads: t.join() Next, exhaust all the items in the  results  queue and print them to the screen: while not  results.empty(): print( "Port  {0}  is open" .format(results.get())) The whole script is: cpython-book-samples 33 portscanner_threads.py from  threading  import  Thread from  queue  import  Queue 259
