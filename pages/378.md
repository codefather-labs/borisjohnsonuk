Appendix 1 : Introduction to C for Python Programmers This introduction is intended to get an experienced Python programmer up to speed with the basics of the C language and how it’s used in the CPython source code. It assumes you’ve already got an intermediate understanding of Python syntax. That said, C is a fairly limited language and most of it’s usage in CPython falls into a small set of syntax. Getting to the point where you understand the code is a much smaller step than being able to write C eﬀectively. This tutorial is aimed at the ﬁrst goal but not the second. One of the ﬁrst things that stand out as a big diﬀerence between Python and C is the C preprocessor. Let’s look at that ﬁrst. 
#C Preprocessor 

 The preprocessor, as the name suggests, is run on your source ﬁles before the compiler runs. It has very limited abilities, but these can be used to great advantage in building C programs. The preprocessor produces a new ﬁle which is what the compiler will actually process. All of the commands to the preprocess start at the beginning of a line with a  #  symbol as the ﬁrst non-whitespace character. The main purpose of the preprocessor is to do text substitution in the source ﬁle, but it will also do some basic conditional code if  #if  state- 378
