Proﬁling Python Code with cProﬁle 
#Pro�ling Python Code with cPro�le 

 The standard library comes with two proﬁlers for proﬁling Python code. The ﬁrst is  profile , a pure-Python proﬁler, and the second, cProfile , a faster proﬁler written in C. In most cases,  cProfile  is the best module to use. The cProﬁle proﬁler is used for analyzing a running application and collecting deterministic proﬁles on the frames evaluated. The output from cProﬁle can be summarized on the command-line, or saved into a  .pstat  ﬁle for analysis in an external tool. In the Parallelism and Concurrency chapter, you wrote a port scanner application in Python. Try proﬁling that application in cProﬁle. Run  python  at the command-line with the  -m cProfile  argument to run the cProﬁle module. The second argument is the script to execute: $ python  - m cProfile portscanner_multithreaded.py Port  80  is  open Completed scan  in  19.8901150226593  seconds 6833  function calls ( 6787  primitive calls)  in  19.971  seconds Ordered by: standard name ncalls tottime percall cumtime percall filename:lineno(function) 2 0.000 0.000 0.000 0.000  ...
