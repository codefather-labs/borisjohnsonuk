The CPython Memory Allocator •  _Free(void *ptr)  - frees memory at  ptr  back to the heap The  PyMemAllocatorDomain  enumeration represents the three domains in CPython as  PYMEM_DOMAIN_RAW ,  PYMEM_DOMAIN_OBJ , and  PYMEM_DOMAIN_MEM . 
##Memory Allocators 

 CPython uses two memory allocators: 1. The Operating System allocator ( malloc ) for the  Raw  memory domain 2. The CPython allocator ( pymalloc ) for the  PyMem  and  Object Memory  domains Note The CPython allocator,  pymalloc , is compiled into CPython by default. You can remove it by recompiling CPython after setting WITH_PYMALLOC = 0  in  pyconfig.h . If you remove it, the PyMem and Object memory domain APIs will use the system allocator. If you compiled CPython with debugging ( --with-pydebug on macOS/Linux, or with the  Debug  target on Windows), then each of the memory allocation functions will go to a Debug implementation. For example, with debugging enabled, your memory allocation calls would execute  _PyMem_DebugAlloc()  instead of  _PyMem_Alloc() . 
#The CPython Memory Allocator 

 The CPython memory allocator sits atop the system memory allocator and has its algorithm for allocation. This algorithm is similar to the system allocator, except that it is customized to CPython: • Most of the memory allocation requests are small, ﬁxedsize because PyObject  is 16 bytes, PyASCIIObject  is 42 bytes, PyCompactUnicodeObject  is 72 bytes, and  PyLongObject  is 32 bytes. 188
