Debugging CPython comes with a builtin debugger for debugging Python applications,  pdb . The pdb debugger is excellent for debugging crashes inside a Python application, for writing tests and inspecting local variables. When it comes to CPython, you need a second debugger, one that understands C. In this chapter, you will learn how to: • Attach a debugger to the CPython interpreter • Use the debugger to see inside a running CPython process There are two types of debugger, console and visual. Console debuggers (like pdb) give you a command prompt and custom commands to explore variables and the stack. Visual debuggers are GUI applications that present the data for you in grids. The following debuggers are covered in this chapter: Debugger Type Platform lldb Console macOS gdb Console Linux Visual Studio Debugger Visual Windows CLion Debugger Visual Windows, macOS, Linux VS Code Debugger Visual Windows, macOS, Linux 331
