This function is later used for stack traces and exception handling. • The memory allocation arena for the compiler is set to the one used by the interpreter. See the Custom Memory Allocators section in the Memory Management chapter for more information on memory allocators. • Any future flags are conﬁgured before the code is compiled. 
#Future Flags and Compiler Flags 

 Before the compiler runs, there are two types of flags to toggle the features inside the compiler. These come from two places: 1. The conﬁguration state, which contains environment variables and command-line flags.  See the chapter on Conﬁguration State . 2. The use of  __future__  statements inside the source code of the module. 
##Future Flags 

 Future flags are required because of the syntax or features in that speciﬁc module. For example, Python 3.7 introduced delayed evaluation of type hints through the  annotations  future flag: 123
