Object and Variable Object Types 
#Object and Variable Object Types 

 Because C is not object-oriented  like Python , objects in C don’t inherit from one another.  PyObject  is the initial data segment for every Python object and  PyObject *  represents a pointer to it. When deﬁning Python types, the  typedef  uses one of two macros: •  PyObject_HEAD  ( PyObject ) for a simple type •  PyObject_VAR_HEAD  ( PyVarObject ) for a container type The simple type  PyObject  has the ﬁelds: Field Type Purpose ob_refcnt Py_ssize_t Instance reference counter ob_type _typeobject* The object type For example, the  cellobject  declares 1 additional ﬁeld,  ob_ref , and the base ﬁelds: typedef struct  { PyObject_HEAD PyObject *ob_ref; /* Content of the cell or NULL when empty */ } PyCellObject; The variable type,  PyVarObject  extends the  PyObject  type and also has the ﬁelds: Field Type Purpose ob_base PyObject The base type ob_size Py_ssize_t Number of items it contains For example, the  int  type,  PyLongObject , has the declaration: struct  _longobject { PyObject_VAR_HEAD 291
