Python and C Modules _PyTime_GetProcessTimeWithInfo()  is implemented multiple diﬀerent ways in the source code, but only certain parts are compiled into the binary for the module depending on the operating system. Windows systems will call  GetProcessTimes()  and Unix systems will call clock_gettime() . Other modules that have multiple implementations for the same API are  the threading module , the ﬁle system module, and the networking modules. Because the Operating Systems behave diﬀerently, the CPython source code implements the same behavior as best as it can and exposes it using a consistent, abstracted API.
