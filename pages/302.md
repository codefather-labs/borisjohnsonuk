##Processing Unicode Code Points 

 CPython does not contain a copy of the UCD, nor does it have to update whenever scripts and characters are added to the Unicode standard. Unicode Strings in CPython only have to care about the encodings, the Operating System has the task of representing the code points in the correct scripts. The Unicode standard includes the UCD and is updated regularly with new scripts, new Emojis, and new characters. Operating Systems take on these updates to Unicode and update their software via a patch. These patches include the new UCD code-points and support the various Unicode encodings. The UCD is split into sections called  code blocks . 302
