Getting the CPython Source Code When you type  python  at the console or install a Python distribution from  python.org , you are running  CPython . CPython is one of many Python implementations, maintained and written by diﬀerent teams of developers. Some  alternatives  you may have heard are  PyPy , Cython , and  Jython . The unique thing about CPython is that it contains both a runtime and the shared language speciﬁcation that all other Python implementations use. CPython is the “oﬃcial” or reference implementation of Python. The Python language speciﬁcation is the document that describes the Python language. For example, it says that  assert  is a reserved keyword, and that  []  is used for indexing, slicing, and creating empty lists.

These are all part of the CPython distribution. There’s a lot more than 21
