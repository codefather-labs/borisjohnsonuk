Garbage Collection collect()  is automatically run. 
##Using the GC API From Python 

 CPython’s standard library comes with a Python module to interface with the arena and the garbage collector, the  gc  module. Here’s how to use the  gc  module in debug mode: >>>  import  gc >>>  gc.set_debug(gc.DEBUG_STATS) This will print the statistics whenever the garbage collector is run: gc: collecting generation  2 ... gc: objects  in  each generation:  3 0 4477 gc: objects  in  permanent generation:  0 gc: done,  0  unreachable,  0  uncollectable,  0.0008 s elapsed You use the  gc.DEBUG_COLLECTABLE  to discover when items are collected for garbage. When you combine this with the  gc.DEBUG_SAVEALL  debug flag, it will move items to a list,  gc.garbage  once they have been collected: >>>  import  gc >>>  gc.set_debug(gc.DEBUG_COLLECTABLE  |  gc.DEBUG_SAVEALL) >>>  z  =  [ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 ] >>>  z.append(z) >>>  del  z >>>  gc.collect() gc: collectable  < list  0x10d594a00 > >>>  gc.garbage [[ 0 ,  1 ,  2 ,  3 , [...]]] You can get the threshold after which the garbage collector is run by calling  get_threshold() : >>>  gc.get_threshold() ( 700 ,  10 ,  10 ) 223
