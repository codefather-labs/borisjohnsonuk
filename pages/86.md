##Viewing Runtime Flags 

 CPython interpreters have a set of runtime flags. These flags are advanced features used for toggling CPython speciﬁc behaviors. Within a Python session, you can access the runtime flags, like verbose mode and quiet mode, by using the  sys.flags  named tuple. All  -X  flags are available inside the  sys._xoptions  dictionary: $ ./python -X dev -q >>> import sys >>> sys.flags sys.flags(debug=0, inspect=0, interactive=0, optimize=0, dont_write_bytecode=0, no_user_site=0, no_site=0, ignore_environment=0, verbose=0, bytes_warning=0, quiet=1, hash_randomization=1, isolated=0, dev_mode=True, utf8_mode=0) >>> sys._xoptions {'dev': True} 
#Build Con�guration 

 As well as the runtime conﬁguration in  Python cpython initconfig.h , there is also a build conﬁguration. This is located inside  pyconfig.h  in 86
