Conclusion This code will handle comparison of floating point numbers where the almost-equal operator has been used. It uses similar logic to math.isclose() , deﬁned in  PEP485 , but with a hardcoded absolute tolerance of  0.1 . After recompiling CPython again, open a REPL and test it out: $ . / python >>>  1.0  ~=  1.01 True >>>  1.02  ~=  1.01 True >>>  1.02  ~=  2.01 False >>>  1  ~=  1.01 True >>>  1  ~=  1 True >>>  1  ~=  2 False >>>  1  ~=  1.9 False >>>  1  ~=  2.0 False >>>  1.1  ~=  1.101 True In later chapters you will extend this implementation across other types. 
#Conclusion 

 In this chapter, you’ve explored how a parsed Python module is converted into a symbol table, a compilation state, and then a series of bytecode operations. 152
