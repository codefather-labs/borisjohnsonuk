#Important Terms 

 • The evaluation loop will take a  code object  and convert it into a series of  frame objects • The interpreter has at least one  thread • Each thread has a  thread state • Frame Objects are executed in a stack, called the  frame stack • Variables are referenced in a  value stack 
#Constructing Thread State 

 Before a frame can be executed, it needs to be linked to a thread. CPython can have many threads running at any one time within a 156
