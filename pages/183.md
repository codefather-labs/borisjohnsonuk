Memory Allocation in C There are three memory allocation mechanisms in C: 1. Static memory allocation, where memory requirements are calculated at compile time and allocated by the executable when it starts 2. Automatic memory allocation, where memory requirements for a scope (e.g., function) are allocated within the call stack when a frame is entered and freed once the frame is terminated 3. Dynamic memory allocation, where memory can be requested and allocated dynamically (i.e., at runtime) by calls to the memory allocation API 
##Static Memory Allocation in C 

 Types in C have a ﬁxed size. For global and static variables, the compiler will calculate the memory requirements for all global/static variables and compile that requirement into the application. For example: static int  number =  0 ; You can see the size of a type in C by using the  sizeof()  function. On my system, a 64-bit macOS running GCC, an  int  is 4 bytes. Basic types in C can have diﬀerent sizes depending on the architecture and compiler. For cases of arrays, these are statically deﬁned, for example, an array of 10 integers: static int  numbers[ 10 ] = { 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 }; The C compiler converts this statement into an allocation of sizeof(int) * 10  bytes of memory. The C compiler uses system calls to allocate memory. These system calls depend on the Operating System and are low-level functions to the Kernel to allocate memory from the system memory pages. 183
