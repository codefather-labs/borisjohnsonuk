Coroutines For example, the letter generator can be refactored into a utility function where the starting letter is an argument. Using  yield from , you can choose which generator object to return: cpython-book-samples 33 letter_coroutines.py def  gen_letters(start, x): i  =  start end  =  start  +  x while  i  <  end: yield  chr(i) i  +=  1 def  letters(upper): if  upper: yield from  gen_letters( 65 ,  26 ) # A-Z else : yield from  gen_letters( 97 ,  26 ) # a-z for  letter  in  letters( False ): # Lower case a-z print(letter) for  letter  in  letters( True ): # Upper case A-Z print(letter) Generators are also great for lazy sequences, where they can be called multiple times. Building on the behaviors of generators, such as being able to pause and resume execution, the concept of a coroutine was iterated in Python over multiple APIs. Generators are a limited form of coroutine because you can send data to them using the  .send() method. It is possible to send messages bi-directionally between the caller and the target. Coroutines also store the caller in the  cr_origin  attribute. 276
