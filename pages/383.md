Basic C Syntax if  (x ==  13 ) printf( "x is 13!n" ); printf( "past the if blockn" ); In general you’ll see that the CPython code is very cleanly formatted and generally sticks to a single style within a given module. if 
## Statements 

 In C,  if  works generally like it does in Python. If the condition is true then the following block is executing. The  else  and  else if  syntax should be familiar enough to Python programmers to understand. Note that C  if  statements do not need and  endif  because blocks are delimited by  {} . There is a shorthand in C for short if/else statements call the  ternary operator : You can ﬁnd it in  semaphore.c  where, for Windows, it deﬁnes a macro for  SEM_CLOSE() : #define SEM_CLOSE(sem) (CloseHandle(sem) ? 0 : -1) The return value of this macro will be  0  if the function  CloseHandle() returns true and  -1  otherwise. Just a note about  true  in C. Boolean variable types are supported and used in parts of the CPython source, but they were not a part of the original language. C interprets binary conditions using a simple rule: 0  or  NULL  is false, everything else is true. switch 
## Statements 

 Unlike Python, C also supports  switch . Using switch can be viewed as a shortcut for extended if/elseif chains. This example is from semaphore.c : 383
