Conclusion 1. Get the hash value of  ob 2. Lookup the hash value of  ob  in the dictionary keys and get the index,  ix 3. If  ix  is empty, return  DKIX_EMPTY  (not found) 4. Get the key entry,  ep  for the given index 5. If the key values match because the object,  ob  is the same pointer at the key value, return the result 6. If the key hashes match because the object,  ob  resolves to the same hash value as  ep->me_mash , return the result Note The  lookupdict()  function is one of few “hot functions” in the CPython source code. “The hot attribute is used to inform the compiler that a function is a hot spot of the compiled program. The function is optimized more aggressively and on many target it is placed into special subsection of the text section so all hot functions appears close together improving locality.” This is speciﬁc to GNUC compilers, but when compiled with PGO, this function is likely to be optimized by the compiler automatically. 
#Conclusion 

 Now that you have seen the implementation of some built-in types, you can explore others. When exploring Python classes, it is important to remember there are built-in types, written in C and classes inheriting from those types, written in Python or C. Some libraries have types written in C instead of inheriting from the 316
