#Instantiating a Compiler 

 Before the compiler starts, a global compiler state is created. The compiler state, ( compiler ), struct contains properties used by the compiler to such as compiler flags, the stack, and the  PyArena . It also contains links to other data structures, like the symbol table. Field Type Purpose c_filename PyObject *  ( str ) A string of the ﬁlename being compiled c_st symtable * The compiler’s symbol table c_future PyFutureFeatures * A pointer to module’s  __future__ c_flags PyCompilerFlags * Inherited compiler flags ( See compiler ﬂags ) c_optimize int Optimization level c_interactive int 1 if in interactive mode c_nestlevel int Current nesting level c_do_not_emit_- bytecode int The compiler won’t emit any bytecode if this value is diﬀerent from zero. This setting can be used to temporarily visit nodes without emitting bytecode to check only errors c_const_cache PyObject *  ( dict ) Python dict holding all constants, including names tuple 122
