Coroutines converted into tasks. The task API is used to schedule and execute multiple coroutines concurrently. Before tasks are scheduled, an event loop must be running. The job of the event loop is to schedule concurrent tasks and connect events such as completion, cancellation, and exceptions with callbacks. When you called  asyncio.run() , the run function (in  Lib asyncio runners.py ) did these tasks for you: 1. Started a new event loop 2. Wrapped the coroutine object in a task 3. Set a callback on the completion of the task 4. Looped over the task until it completed 5. Returned the result

##Event Loops 

 Event loops are the glue that holds async code together. Written in pure Python, event loops are an object containing tasks. When started, a loop can either run once or run forever. Any of the tasks in the loop can have callbacks. The loop will run the callbacks if a task completes or fails. 278
