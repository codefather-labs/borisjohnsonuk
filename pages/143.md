#Creating a Code Object 

 The task of  makecode()  is to go through the compiler state, some of the assemblerâ€™s properties, and to put these into a  PyCodeObject  by calling PyCode_New() . The variable names, constants are put as properties to the code object: Python compile.c  line 5888 static  PyCodeObject * makecode( struct  compiler *c,  struct  assembler *a) { ... consts = consts_dict_keys_inorder(c->u->u_consts); names = dict_keys_inorder(c->u->u_names,  0 ); varnames = dict_keys_inorder(c->u->u_varnames,  0 ); ... cellvars = dict_keys_inorder(c->u->u_cellvars,  0 ); 143
