Generators >>>  for  letter  in  letters(): ... print(letter) a b c d ... This implementation uses the iterator protocol. Objects that have a __next__()  method can be looped over by  for  and  while  loops, or using the  next()  builtin. All container types (like lists, sets, tuples) in Python implement the iterator protocol. Generators are unique because the implementation of the  __next__()  method recalls the generator function from its last state. Generators are not executing in the background, they are paused. When you request another value, they resume execution. Within the generator object structure is the frame object as it was at the last  yield  statement. 
##Generator Structure 

 Generator objects are created by a template macro,  _PyGenObject_- HEAD(prefix) . This macro is used by the following types and preÔ¨Åxes: 1.  PyGenObject  -  gi_  (Generator objects) 2.  PyCoroObject  -  cr_  (Coroutine objects) 3.  PyAsyncGenObject  -  ag_  (Async generator objects) You will cover coroutine and async generator objects later in this chapter. The  PyGenObject  type has the base properties: 270
