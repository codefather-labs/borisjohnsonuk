Memory Allocation in C 
##Automatic Memory Allocation in C 

 Similar to static memory allocation, automatically memory allocation will calculate the memory allocation requirements at compile-time. This example application will calculate 100 degrees Fahrenheit in Celsius: cpython-book-samples 32 automatic.c #include  <stdio.h> static const double  five_ninths =  5.0 / 9.0 ; double  celsius( double  fahrenheit){ double  c = (fahrenheit -  32 ) * five_ninths; return  c; } int  main() { double  f =  100 ; printf( "%f F is %f Cn" , f, celsius(f)); return  0 ; } Both static and dynamic memory allocation techniques are being used in the last example: • The const value  five_ninths  is  statically  allocated because it has the  static  keyword • The variable  c  within the function  celsius()  is allocated  automatically  when  celsius()  is called and freed when it is completed • The variable  f  within the function  main()  is allocated  automatically  when  main()  is called and freed when it is completed • The result of  celsius(f)  is implicitly allocated  automatically • The automatic memory requirements of  main()  are freed when the function completes 184
