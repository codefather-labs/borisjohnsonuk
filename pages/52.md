#Compiling CPython on Windows 

 There are two ways to compile the CPython binaries and libraries from Windows. The ﬁrst is to compile from the command line, this still requires the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler, which comes with Visual Studio. The second is to open the  PCBuild pcbuild.sln  from Visual Studio and build directly. 
##Installing the Dependencies 

 For either the command line compile script or the Visual Studio solution, you need to install several external tools, libraries, and C headers. Inside the  PCBuild  folder there is a  .bat  ﬁle that automates this for you. 52
