You can see CPythonâ€™s frame stack anytime an exception is unhandled: Traceback (most recent call last): File "example_stack.py", line 8, in <module> <--- Frame function1() File "example_stack.py", line 5, in function1 <--- Frame function2() File "example_stack.py", line 2, in function2 <--- Frame raise RuntimeError RuntimeError When exploring the CPython compiler, you broke out just before the call to  run_eval_code_obj() .
