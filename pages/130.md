Symbol Tables variable. In Python, functions are objects, so they can be passed as parameters or references. 3. Any non-literal default arguments to a function (non-keyword) are resolved from the symbol table. 4. Any non-literal default arguments to a function (keyword) are resolved from the symbol table. 5. Any type annotations for the arguments or the return type are resolved from the symbol table. 6. Any function decorators are resolved in sequence of deﬁnition. 7. The code block with the contents of the function is visited by symtable_enter_block() . 8. The arguments are visited and resolved. 9. The body of the function is visited and resolved. Important If you’ve ever wondered why Python’s default arguments are mutable, the reason is in  symtable_visit_stmt() . Argument defaults are a reference to the variable in the symtable. No extra work is done to copy any values to an immutable type. As a preview, the C code for those steps in building a symtable for a function in  symtable_visit_stmt() : Python symtable.c  line 1171 static int symtable_visit_stmt( struct  symtable *st, stmt_ty s) { if  (++st->recursion_depth > st->recursion_limit) { PyErr_SetString(PyExc_RecursionError, "maximum recursion depth exceeded during compilation" ); VISIT_QUIT(st,  0 ); } 130
