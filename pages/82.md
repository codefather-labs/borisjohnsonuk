Note Similar to the  PEP8  style guide for Python code, there is  PEP7 for the CPython C code. There are some naming standards for C source code: • Use a  Py  preﬁx for public functions, never for static functions. The  Py_  preﬁx is reserved for global service routines like  Py_- FatalError . Speciﬁc groups of routines (like speciﬁc object type APIs) use a longer preﬁx, such as  PyString_  for string functions. • Public functions and variables use MixedCase with underscores, like this:  PyObject_GetAttr() ,  Py_BuildValue() ,  PyExc_- TypeError() . • Occasionally an “internal” function has to be visible to the loader. Use the  _Py  preﬁx for this, for example,  _PyObject_- Dump() . • Macros should have a MixedCase preﬁx and then use upper case, for example  PyString_AS_STRING ,  Py_PRINT_RAW . Unlike PEP8, there are few tools for checking the compliance of PEP7. This task is instead done by the core developers as part of code reviews. As with any human-operated process, it isn’t perfect so you will likely ﬁnd code that does not adhere to PEP7. The only bundled tool is a script called  smelly.py , which you can execute using the  make smelly  target on Linux or macOS, or via the command line: $ ./python Tools/scripts/smelly.py This will raise an error for any symbols that are in  libpython  (the shared CPython library) that do not start  Py , or  _Py . 82
