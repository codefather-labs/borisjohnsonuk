Another, much better, solution—and the point of async programming—is to modify our code so that we use only one ThreadBot and configure it to move between  *all*  the tables as necessary. For our case study, this means that the knives and forks in the kitchen will get modified by only a single thread. And even better, in our async programs, we’ll be able to see exactly where context will switch between multiple concurrent coroutines, because the  `await`  keyword indicates such places explicitly. I’ve decided against showing an async version of this case study here, because  Chapter 3  explains how to use  `asyncio`  in depth. But if your curiosity is insatiable, there is an annotated example in  Example B-1 ; it’ll probably only make sense after you read the next chapter! **Case Study: Robots and Cutlery ** **| ** **19**
