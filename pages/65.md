The example used in the previous section to demonstrate an async iterator for interaction with Redis turns out to be much simpler if we set it up as an async generator, shown in  Example 3-26 . *Example 3-26. Easier with an async generator* `import` ` ` `asyncio` `from` ` ` `aioredis` ` ` `import` ` ` `create_redis` `async` ` ` `def` ` ` `main` `():` `  ` `    ` `redis` ` ` `=` ` ` `await` ` ` `create_redis` `((` `'localhost'` `,` ` ` `6379` `))` `    ` `keys` ` ` `=` ` ` `[` `'Americas'` `,` ` ` `'Africa'` `,` ` ` `'Europe'` `,` ` ` `'Asia'` `]` `    ` `async` ` ` `for` ` ` `value` ` ` `in` ` ` `one_at_a_time` `(` `redis` `,` ` ` `keys` `):` `  ` `        ` `await` ` ` `do_something_with` `(` `value` `)` `async` ` ` `def` ` ` `one_at_a_time` `(` `redis` `,` ` ` `keys` `):` `  ` `    ` `for` ` ` `k` ` ` `in` ` ` `keys` `:` `        ` `value` ` ` `=` ` ` `await` ` ` `redis` `.` `get` `(` `k` `)` `  ` `        ` `yield` ` ` `value` `  ` `asyncio` `.` `run` `(` `main` `())` The  `main()`  function is identical to the version in  Example 3-25 . Well, almost identical: I changed the name from  `CamelCase`  to  `snake_case` . Our function is now declared with  `async def` , making it a  *coroutine function* , and since this function also contains the  `yield`  keyword, we refer to it as an  *asynchronous generator function* . We don’t have to do the convoluted things necessary in the previous example with  `self.ikeys` : here, we just loop over the keys directly and obtain the value… …and then yield it to the caller, just like a normal generator. It might seem complex if this is new to you, but I urge you to play around with this yourself on a few toy examples. It starts to feel natural pretty quickly. Async generators are likely to become popular in  `asyncio` -based codebases because they bring all the same benefits as normal generators: making code shorter and simpler. **54 ** **| ** **Chapter 3: Asyncio Walk-Through**
