The Evaluation Loop So far, you have seen how Python code is parsed into an Abstract Syntax Tree and compiled into code objects. These code objects contain lists of discreet operations in the form of bytecode. There is one major thing missing for these code objects to be executed and come to life. They need input. In the case of Python, these inputs take the form of local and global variables. In this chapter, you will be introduced to a concept called a Value Stack, where variables are created, modiﬁed, and used by the bytecode operations in your compiled code objects. Execution of code in CPython happens within a central loop, called the “evaluation loop.” The CPython interpreter will evaluate and execute a code object, either fetched from the marshaled  .pyc  ﬁle, or the compiler: Execution Parser AST Bytecode Compiler Assembler CFG In the evaluation loop, each of the bytecode instructions is taken and executed using a  “Stack Frame” based system . 154
