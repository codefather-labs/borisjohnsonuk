The Object and PyMem Memory Allocation Domains return  (PyLongObject*)PyObject_INIT_VAR(result, &PyLong_Type, size); } If you were to call  _PyLong_New(2) , it would calculate: Value Bytes sizeof(digit) 4 size 2 header oﬀset 26 Total 32 A call to  PyObject_MALLOC()  would be made with a  size_t  value of 32. On my system, the maximum number of digits in a long,  MAX_LONG_- DIGITS , is  2305843009213693945  (a very, very big number). If you ran  _- PyLong_New(2305843009213693945)  it would call  PyObject_MALLOC()  with a size_t  of  9223372036854775804  bytes, or 8,589,934,592 Gigabytes (more RAM than I have available). 
##Using the 

  tracemalloc 
## Module 

 The  tracemalloc  in the standard library can be used to debug memory allocation through the Object Allocator. It provides information on where an object was allocated, and the number of memory blocks allocated. As a debug tool, it is beneﬁcial to calculate the amount of memory consumed by running your code or detect memory leaks. To enable memory tracing, you should start Python with the  -X tracemalloc=1 , where 1 is the number of frames deep you want to trace. Alternatively, you can enable memory tracing using the PYTHONTRACEMALLOC=1  environment variable. 1 is the number of frames deep you want to trace and can be replaced with any integer. You can use the  take_snapshot()  function to create a snapshot instance, then compare multiple snapshots using  compare_to() . 200
