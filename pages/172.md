The Value Stack a Before After a result If you were to add 2 values to the stack: PyObject *a = PyLong_FromLong( 10 ); PyObject *b = PyLong_FromLong( 20 ); PUSH(a); PUSH(b); They would end up in the order in which they were added, so  a  would be pushed to the second position in the stack: a a Before After b b If you were to fetch the top value in the stack, you would get a pointer to  b  because it is at the top: PyObject *val = POP();  // returns ptr to b 172
