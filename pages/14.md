Contents include its readability and a welcoming community dedicated to education. Anthony embraces these strengths when explaining CPython, encouraging you to read the source, and sharing the building blocks of the language with you. Why do I want to share Anthony’s  CPython Internals  with you? It’s the book that I wish existed years ago when I started my Python journey. More importantly, I believe we, as members of the Python community, have a unique opportunity – to put our expertise to work to help solve the complex real-world problems facing us. I’m conﬁdent after reading this book your skills will grow and you will be able solve even more complex problems that can improve our world. It’s my hope that Anthony motivates you to learn more about Python, inspire you to build innovative things, and give you conﬁdence to share your creations with the world. “Now is better than Never.” — Tim Peters, The Zen of Python Let’s follow Tim’s wisdom and get started now.
