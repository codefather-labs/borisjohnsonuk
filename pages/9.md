 •  Detailed, extended case studies with code, showing how to use a few of the more popular Asyncio-compatible third-party libraries We’ll begin with a story that illustrates the shift in thinking that must accompany a transition from threaded to async programming. Then, we’ll take a look at the changes that were made in the Python language itself to accommodate async programming. Finally, we’ll explore some of the ways in which these new features can be used most effectively. The new Asyncio features are not going to radically change the way you write programs. They provide specific tools that make sense only for specific situations; but in the right situations,  `asyncio`  is exceptionally useful. In this book, we’re going to explore those situations and how you can best approach them by using the new Asyncio features. ### Conventions Used in This Book
