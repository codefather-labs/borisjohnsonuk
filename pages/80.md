Con�guration and Input Now that you’ve seen the Python grammar, its time to explore how code gets input into a state that can be executed. There are many ways Python code can be run in CPython. Here are some of the most commonly used: 1. By running  python -c  and a Python string 2. By running  python -m  and the name of a module 3. By running  python [file]  with the path to a ﬁle that contains Python code 4. By piping Python code into the  python  executable over stdin, e.g., cat [file] | python 5. By starting a REPL and executing commands one at a time 6. By using the C API and using Python as an embedded environment See Also Python has so many ways to execute scripts; it can be a little overwhelming. Darren Jones has put together a  great course at realpython.com on running Python scripts  if you want to learn more. 80
