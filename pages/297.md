Bool and Long Integer Type The implementation of  and  for a  bool  value ﬁrst checks if  a  and  b  are booleans. If they arent, they are cast as numbers, and the  and  operation is run on the two numbers: Objects boolobject.c  line 61 static  PyObject * bool_and(PyObject *a, PyObject *b) { if  (!PyBool_Check(a) || !PyBool_Check(b)) return  PyLong_Type.tp_as_number->nb_and(a, b); return  PyBool_FromLong((a == Py_True) & (b == Py_True)); } 
##Long Type 

 The  long  type is a bit more complex than  bool . In the transition from Python 2 to 3, CPython dropped support for the  int  type and instead used the  long  type as the primary integer type. Python’s  long  type is quite special in that it can store a variable-length number. The maximum length is set in the compiled binary. The data structure of a Python  long  consists of the  PyObject  variable header and a list of digits. The list of digits,  ob_digit  is initially set to have one digit, but it later expanded to a longer length when initialized: Include longintrepr.h  line 85 struct  _longobject { PyObject_VAR_HEAD digit ob_digit[ 1 ]; }; For example, the number 1 would have the  ob_digits [1] , and 24601 would have the  ob_digits [2, 4, 6, 0, 1] . Memory is allocated to a new  long  through  _PyLong_New() . This function takes a ﬁxed length and makes sure it is smaller than  MAX_LONG_DIGITS . 297
