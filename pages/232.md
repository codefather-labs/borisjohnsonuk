For each child process, it continued at the line  child = fork() , where the resulting value of  child  is 0. It then completes the calculation, prints the value, and exits the process. Finally, the parent process outputs how many processes it spawned, and itâ€™s own PID. The time taken for the 3rd and 4th child processes to complete was longer than it took for the parent process to complete. This is why 232
