Symbol Tables 
##Compiler Flags 

 The other compiler flags are speciﬁc to the environment, so they might change the way the code executes or the way the compiler runs, but they shouldn’t link to the source in the same way that  __future__  statements do. One example of a compiler flag would be the  -O  flag for optimizing the use of  assert  statements . This flag disables any  assert  statements, which may have been put in the code for  debugging purposes . It can also be enabled with the  PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1  environment variable setting. 
#Symbol Tables 

 Before the code is compiled, a  symbol table  is created by the PySymtable_BuildObject()  API. The purpose of the symbol table is to provide a list of namespaces, globals, and locals for the compiler to use for referencing and resolving scopes.

##Symbol Table Data Structure 

 The  symtable  structure should be one symtable instance for the compiler, so namespacing becomes essential. 125
