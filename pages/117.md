Example: Adding an Almost Equal Comparison Operator |'is' 'not' */ REQ(n, comp_op); if  (NCH(n) ==  1 ) { n = CHILD(n,  0 ); switch  (TYPE(n)) { case  LESS: return  Lt; case  GREATER: return  Gt; case  ALMOSTEQUAL:  // Add this line to catch the token return  AlE; // And this one to return the AST node Now recompile CPython and open up a REPL to test the command: >>>  a  =  1 >>>  b  =  1.0 >>>  a  ~=  b True At this stage, the tokenizer and the AST can parse this code, but the compiler won’t know how to handle the operator. To test the AST representation, use the  ast.parse()  function and explore the ﬁrst operator in the expression: >>>  import  ast >>>  m  =  ast.parse( '1 ~= 2' ) >>>  m.body[ 0 ].value.ops[ 0 ] < _ast.AlE object at  0x10a8d7ee0 > This is an instance of our  AlE  comparison operator type, so the AST has correctly parsed the code. In the next chapter, you will learn about how the CPython compiler works, and revisit the almost-equal operator to build out its behavior. 117
