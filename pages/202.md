The Raw Memory Allocation Domain 
#The Raw Memory Allocation Domain 

 The Raw Memory Allocation domain is used either directly, or when the other two domains are called with a request size over 512 KB. It takes the request size, in bytes, and calls  malloc(size) . If the size argument is 0, some systems will return NULL for malloc(0), which would be treated as an error. Some platforms would return a pointer with no memory behind it, which would break pymalloc. To solve these problems,  _PyMem_- RawMalloc()  will add an extra byte before calling  malloc() . Important By default, the PyMem Domain allocators will use the Object Allocators. PyMem_Malloc()  and  PyObject_Malloc()  will have the same execution path. 
#Custom Domain Allocators 

 CPython also allows for the allocation implementation for any of the three domains to be overridden. If your system environment required bespoke memory checks or algorithms for memory allocation, then you can plug a new set of allocation functions into the runtime. PyMemAllocatorEx  is a  typedef  struct with members for all of the methods you would need to implement to override the allocator: typedef struct  { /* user context passed as the first argument to the 4 functions */ void  *ctx; /* allocate a memory block */ void * (*malloc) ( void  *ctx,  size_t  size); /* allocate a memory block initialized by zeros */ 202
