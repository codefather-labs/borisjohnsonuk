##Creating Generators 

 When a function containing a  yield  statement is compiled, the resulting code object has an additional flag,  CO_GENERATOR . In the chapter on the Execution Loop: Constructing Frames, you explored how a compiled code object is converted into a frame object when it is executed. In the process, there is a special case for generators, coroutines, and async generators. The  _PyEval_EvalCode()  function checks the code object for the  CO_GENERATOR ,  CO_COROUTINE , and  CO_ASYNC_GENERATOR  flags. Instead of evaluation a code object inline, the frame is created and turned into a Generator, Coroutine or Async Generator Object. A coroutine is created using  PyCoro_New() , an async generator is created with  PyAsyncGen_New() , and a generator with  PyGen_NewWithQualName() : PyObject * _PyEval_EvalCode(PyObject *_co, PyObject *globals, PyObject *locals, ... ... /* Handle generator/coroutine/asynchronous generator */ if  (co->co_flags & (CO_GENERATOR | CO_COROUTINE | CO_ASYNC_GENERATOR)) { PyObject *gen; PyObject *coro_wrapper = tstate->coroutine_wrapper; int  is_coro = co->co_flags & CO_COROUTINE; ... /* Create a new generator that owns the ready to run frame * and return that as the value. */ if  (is_coro) { >>> gen = PyCoro_New(f, name, qualname); }  else if  (co->co_flags & CO_ASYNC_GENERATOR) { >>> gen = PyAsyncGen_New(f, name, qualname); }  else  { >>> gen = PyGen_NewWithQualName(f, name, qualname); 272
