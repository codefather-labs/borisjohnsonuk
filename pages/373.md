#the CPython Project 

 While writing this book, CPython had 12 new minor releases, 100’s of changes, bug reports, and 1000’s of commits to the source code. CPython is one of the biggest, most vibrant, and open software projects out there. So what sets apart the developers who work on CPython and you, the reader? Nothing. That’s right; the only thing stopping you from submitting a change, improvement, or ﬁx to CPython is knowing where to start. The CPython community is eager for more contributors. Here are some places you could start: 1. Triaging issues raised by developers on  bugs.python.org 2. Fixing small, easy issues Let’s explore each of those in a bit more detail. 
##Triaging Issues 

 All bug reports and change requests are ﬁrst submitted to bugs.python.org . This website is the bug tracker for the CPython Project. Even if you want to submit a pull request on GitHub, you ﬁrst need a “BPO Number,” which is the issue number created by BPO (bugs.python.org). To get started, register yourself as a user by going to   User Register  on the left menu. The default view is not particularly productive and shows both issues raised by users and those raised by core developers (which likely already have a ﬁx). Instead, after logging in, go to   Your Queries Edit  on the left menu. 373
