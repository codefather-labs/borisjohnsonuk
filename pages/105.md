##Using Instaviz to View Abstract Syntax Trees 

 Instaviz is a Python package written for this book. It displays ASTs and compiled code in a web interface. To install  instaviz , install the  instaviz  package from  pip : $ pip install instaviz Then, open up a REPL by running  python  at the command line with no arguments. The function  instaviz.show()  takes a single argument of type  code object . You will cover code objects in the next chapter. For this example, deﬁne a function and use the name of the function as the argument value: $ python >>>  import  instaviz >>>  def  example(): a  =  1 b  =  a  +  1 return  b >>>  instaviz.show(example) You’ll see a notiﬁcation on the command-line that a web server has started on port  8080 . If you were using that port for something else, you could change it by calling  instaviz.show(example, port=9090)  or another port number. In the web browser, you can see the detailed breakdown of your function: 105
