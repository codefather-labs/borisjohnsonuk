The Value Stack Before After a a a There is a rotation macro  ROT_TWO  that swaps the ﬁrst and second values. ROT_TWO(); a Before After b b a 
##Stack E�ects 

 Each of the opcodes has a predeﬁned  stack e�ect,  calculated by the stack_effect()  function inside  Python compile.c . This function returns the delta in the number of values inside the stack for each opcode. Stack eﬀects can have a positive, negative, or zero value. Once the operation has been executed, if the stack eﬀect (e.g., +1) does not match the delta in the value stack, an exception is raised to ensure there is no corruption to objects on the value stack. 174
