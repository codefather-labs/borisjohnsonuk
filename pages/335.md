Using Lldb for macOS (lldb) process attach --pid 123 You can get the process ID from the Activity Monitor, or using os.getpid()  in Python. Any breakpoints setup before this point or afterward will halt the process. 
##An Example of Handling a Breakpoint 

 To see how breakpoints are handled, set a breakpoint on the  Objects floatobject.c  float_richcompare()  function. Next run the process and compare 2 float values using the almost-equal operator that you developed during this book: (lldb) process launch -- -c "1.0~=1.1" Process 64421 launched: '/cpython/python.exe' (x86_64) Process 64421 stopped * thread #1, queue = '...', stop reason = breakpoint 1.1 frame #0: 0x000000010006a974 python.exe`float_richcompare(v=1.0, w=1.1, op=6) at floatobject.c:532:26 529 break; 530 case Py_AlE: { 531 double diff = fabs(i - j); -> 532 const double rel_tol = 1e-9; 533 const double abs_tol = 0.1; 534 r = (((diff <= fabs(rel_tol * j)) || Target 0: (python.exe) stopped. lldb will give you a prompt again. You can see the local variables by using the command  v : (lldb) v (PyObject *) v = 0x000000010111b370 1.0 (PyObject *) w = 0x000000010111b340 1.1 (int) op = 6 (double) i = 1 (double) j = 1.1000000000000001 335
