The Object and PyMem Memory Allocation Domains loop. An excellent example of the Object memory allocator being used is the PyLongObject  ( int ) type constructor,  PyLong_New() . • When a new  int  is constructed, memory is allocated from the Object Allocator. • The size of the request is the size of the  PyLongObject  struct, plus the amount of memory required to store the digits. Python longs are not equivalent to C’s  long  type. They are a  list  of digits. The number  12378562834  in Python would be represented as the list of digits  [1,2,3,7,8,5,6,2,8,3,4] . This memory structure is how Python can deal with huge numbers without having to worry about 32 or 64-bit integer constraints. Take a look at the  PyLong  constructor to see an example of object memory allocation: PyLongObject * _PyLong_New(Py_ssize_t size) { PyLongObject *result; ... if  (size > (Py_ssize_t)MAX_LONG_DIGITS) { PyErr_SetString(PyExc_OverflowError, "too many digits in integer" ); return  NULL; } result = PyObject_MALLOC(offsetof(PyLongObject, ob_digit) + size* sizeof (digit)); if  (!result) { PyErr_NoMemory(); return  NULL; } 199
