##Compiling From Visual Studio 

 Inside the  PCBuild  folder is a Visual Studio project ﬁle,  PCBuild pcbuild.sln , for building and exploring CPython source code. When the Solution is loaded, it will prompt you to retarget the project’s inside the Solution to the version of the C/C++ compiler you have installed. Visual Studio will also target the release of the Windows SDK you have installed. Ensure that you change the Windows SDK version to the newest installed version and the platform toolset to the latest version. If you missed this window, you can right-click on the Solution in the  Solutions and Projects  window and click  Retarget Solution . Navigate to   Build Configuration Manager  and ensure the “Active solution conﬁguration” is set to  Debug , and the “Active Solution Platform” is set to  x64  for 64-bit CPU architecture or  win32  for 32-bit. Next, build CPython by pressing   CTRL  +  SHIFT  +  B  , or choosing Build Build Solution  . If you receive any errors about the Windows SDK being missing, make sure you set the right targeting settings in the  Retarget Solution  window. You should also see  Windows Kits  inside your Start Menu, and  Windows Software Development Kit  inside of that menu. The build stage could take 10 minutes or more the ﬁrst time. Once the build completes, you may see a few warnings that you can ignore. 55
