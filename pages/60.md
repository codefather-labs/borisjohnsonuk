Conclusion functions that tend to be along the same execution path are moved to the same section of the compiled application. •  Conditional Branch Optimization  - PGO can look at a decision branch, like an  if..else if  or  switch  statement and spot the most commonly used path. For example, if there are 10 cases in a  switch  statement and one is used 95% of the time, then it will be moved to the top so that it will be executed immediately in the code path. •  Dead-Spot Separation  - Code that isn’t called during PGO is moved to a separate section of the application. 
#Conclusion 

 In this chapter, you’ve seen how to compile CPython source code into a working interpreter. You can use this knowledge throughout the book as you explore and adapt the source code. You might need to repeat the compilation steps tens, or even hundreds of times when working with CPython. If you can adapt your development environment to create shortcuts for recompilation, it is better to do that now and save yourself a lot of time. Leave feedback on this section » 60
