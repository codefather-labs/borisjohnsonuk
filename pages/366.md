##Installing Dtrace 

 dtrace comes pre-installed on macOS, and can be installed in Linux using one of the packaging tools: For  yum  based systems: $ yum install systemtap-sdt-devel Or, for  apt  based systems: $ apt-get install systemtap-sdt-dev 
##Compiling Dtrace Support 

 dtrace support must be compiled into CPython. This is done by the ./configuration  script. Run  ./configure  again with the same arguments you used in Compiling CPython and add the flag  --with-dtrace . Once this is complete, you need to run  make clean && make  to rebuild the binary. Check that the probe header was created by the conﬁguration tool: 366
