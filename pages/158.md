#Constructing Frame Objects 

 Compiled code objects are inserted into frame objects. Frame objects are a Python type, so they can be referenced from C, and from Python. Frame objects also contain other runtime data that is required for executing the instructions in the code objects. This data includes the local variables, global variables and builtin modules. 
##Frame Object Type 

 The frame object type is a  PyObject  with the following additional properties: Field Type Purpose f_back PyFrameObject * Pointer to the previous in the stack, or  NULL  if ﬁrst frame f_code PyCodeObject * Code Object to be executed f_builtins PyObject *  ( dict ) Symbol table for the  builtin  module f_globals PyObject *  ( dict ) global symbol table (PyDictObject f_locals PyObject * Local symbol table (any mapping) f_valuestack PyObject ** Pointer to the last local f_stacktop PyObject ** Next free slot in  f_valuestack f_trace PyObject * Pointer to a custom tracing function. See section on frame tracing f_trace_lines char Toggle for the custom tracing function to trace at line-level f_trace_- opcodes char Toggle for the custom tracing function to trace at an opcode level f_gen Pybject * Borrowed reference to a generator, or  NULL 158
