Unicode String Type UnicodeDecodeError :  'utf-16-le'  codec can 't decode byte 0x61 in position 0: truncated data This is important to note when you are selecting an encoding mechanism. UTF8 is a safer option if you need to import ASCII encoded data. 
##Wide Character Type 

 When handling Unicode string input in an unknown encoding within the CPython source code, the  wchar_t  C type will be used.  wchar_t  is the C standard for a wide-character string and is suﬃcient to store Unicode strings in memory. After  PEP 393 , the  wchar_t  type was selected as the Unicode storage format. The Unicode string object provides a utility function,  PyUnicode_- FromWideChar() , that will convert a  wchar_t  constant to a string object. For example, the  pymain_run_command() , used by  python -c  converts the -c  argument into a Unicode string: Modules main.c  line 226 static int pymain_run_command( wchar_t  *command, PyCompilerFlags *cf) { PyObject *unicode, *bytes; int  ret; unicode = PyUnicode_FromWideChar(command,  -1 ); 
##Byte Order Markers 

 When decoding an input, like a ﬁle, CPython can detect the byte-order from a byte-order-marker (BOM). BOMs are a special character that appears at the beginning of a Unicode byte stream. They tell the receiver which byte-order the data is stored in. Diﬀerent computer systems can encode with diﬀerent byte-orders. If the wrong byte-order is used, even with the right encoding, the data will be garbled. 305
