#Conclusion 

 In this chapter, you’ve been introduced to the Python grammar deﬁnitions and parser generator. In the next chapter, you’ll expand on that knowledge to build a more complex syntax feature, an “almost-equals” operator. In practice, changes to the Python grammar have to be carefully considered and discussed. There are two reasons for the level of scrutiny: 1. Having “too many” language features, or a complex grammar would change the ethos of Python being a simple and readable language 2. Changes to grammar introduce backward-incompatibilities, which create work for all developers If a Python Core Developer proposes a change to the grammar, it must be proposed as a Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP). All PEPs are numbered and indexed on the PEP index.  PEP 5  documents the guidelines for evolving the language and speciﬁes that changes must be proposed in PEPs. Members can also suggest changes to the language outside of the core development group through the  python-ideas mailing list . You can see the drafted, rejected, and accepted PEPs for future versions of CPython in the  PEP index . Once a PEP has consensus, and the draft has been ﬁnalized, the Steering Council must accept or reject it. The mandate of the Steering Council, deﬁned in  PEP 13 , states that they shall work to “Maintain the quality and stability of the Python language and CPython interpreter.” 78
