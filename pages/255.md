Multithreading 
##Conclusion 

 Multiprocessing oﬀers a scalable, parallel execution API for Python. Data can be shared between processes, and CPU-intensive work can be broken into parallel tasks to take advantage of multiple core or CPU computers. Multiprocessing is not a suitable solution when the task to be completed is not CPU intensive, but instead IO-bound. For example, if you spawned 4 worker processes to read and write to the same ﬁles, one would do all the work, and the other 3 would wait for the lock to be released. Multiprocessing is also not suitable for short-lived tasks, because of the time and processing overhead of starting a new Python interpreter. In both of those scenarios, you main ﬁnd one of the next approaches is more suited. 
#Multithreading 

 CPython provides a high-level and a low-level API for creating, spawning, and controlling threads from Python. To understand Python threads, you should ﬁrst understand how Operating System threads work. There are two implementations of threading in CPython. 1.  pthreads  - POSIX threads for Linux and macOS 2.  nt threads  - NT threads for Windows In the section on The Structure of a Process, you saw how a process has: • A  Stack  of subroutines • A  Heap  of memory 255
