A Quick Primer on Make Take the  docclean  target as an example. This target deletes some generated documentation ﬁles using the  rm  command. docclean: - rm -rf Doc/build - rm -rf Doc/tools/sphinx Doc/tools/pygments Doc/tools/docutils To execute this target, run  make docclean .  docclean  is a simple target as it only runs two commands. The convention for executing any make target is: $ make [options] [target] If you call  make  without specifying a target.  make  will run the default target, which is the ﬁrst speciﬁed in the  Makefile . For CPython, this is the  all  target which compiles all parts of CPython. Make has many options, so here are the ones I think you’ll ﬁnd useful throughout this book: Option Use -d ,  --debug[=FLAGS] Print various types of debugging information -e ,  --environment-overrides Environment variables override makeﬁles -i ,  --ignore-errors Ignore errors from commands -j [N] ,  --jobs[=N] Allow N jobs at once (inﬁnite jobs otherwise) -k ,  --keep-going Keep going when some targets can’t be made -l [N] ,  --load-average[=N] --max-load[=N] Only start multiple jobs if load < N -n ,  --dry-run Print commands instead of running them. -s ,  --silent Don’t echo commands. -S ,  --stop Turns oﬀ  -k . In the next section and throughout the book, I’m going to ask you to run  make  with the options: $ make -j2 -s [target] The  -j2  flag allows  make  to run 2 jobs simultaneously. If you have 4 49
