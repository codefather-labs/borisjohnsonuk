### Async Comprehensions
 Now that we’ve seen how Python supports asynchronous iteration, the next natural question to ask is whether it also works for list comprehensions—and the answer is *yes* . This support was introduced in  PEP 530 , and I recommend you take a look at the PEP yourself; it is short and readable.  Example 3-27  shows how typical async comprehensions are laid out. *Example 3-27. Async list, dict, and set comprehensions* `>>>` ` ` `import` ` ` `asyncio` `>>>` `>>>` ` ` `async` ` ` `def` ` ` `doubler` `(` `n` `):` `...` `     ` `for` ` ` `i` ` ` `in` ` ` `range` `(` `n` `):` `...` `         ` `yield` ` ` `i` `,` ` ` `i` ` ` `*` ` ` `2` `  ` `...` `         ` `await` ` ` `asyncio` `.` `sleep` `(` `0.1` `)` `  ` `...` `>>>` ` ` `async` ` ` `def` ` ` `main` `():` `...` `     ` `result` ` ` `=` ` ` `[` `x` ` ` `async` ` ` `for` ` ` `x` ` ` `in` ` ` `doubler` `(` `3` `)]` `  ` `...` `     ` `print` `(` `result` `)` `...` `     ` `result` ` ` `=` ` ` `{` `x` `:` ` ` `y` ` ` `async` ` ` `for` ` ` `x` `,` ` ` `y` ` ` `in` ` ` `doubler` `(` `3` `)}` `  ` `...` `     ` `print` `(` `result` `)` `...` `     ` `result` ` ` `=` ` ` `{` `x` ` ` `async` ` ` `for` ` ` `x` ` ` `in` ` ` `doubler` `(` `3` `)}` `  ` `...` `     ` `print` `(` `result` `)` `...` `>>>` ` ` `asyncio` `.` `run` `(` `main` `())` `[(` `0` `,` ` ` `0` `),` ` ` `(` `1` `,` ` ` `2` `),` ` ` `(` `2` `,` ` ` `4` `)]` `{` `0` `:` ` ` `0` `,` ` ` `1` `:` ` ` `2` `,` ` ` `2` `:` ` ` `4` `}` `{(` `2` `,` ` ` `4` `),` ` ` `(` `1` `,` ` ` `2` `),` ` ` `(` `0` `,` ` ` `0` `)}` `doubler()`  is a very simple async generator: given an upper value, it’ll iterate over a simple range, yielding a tuple of the value and its double. Sleep a little, just to emphasize that this is really an async function. An async list comprehension: note how  `async for`  is used instead of the usual `for` . This difference is the same as that shown in the examples in  “Async Iterators: async for” on page 50 . An async dict comprehension; all the usual tricks work, such as unpacking the tuple into  `x`  and  `y`  so that they can feed the dict comprehension syntax. The async set comprehension works exactly as you would expect. **Async Comprehensions ** **| ** **55**
