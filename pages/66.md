The Python Language Speciﬁcation 
##The Grammar File 

 Important This section refers to the grammar ﬁle used by the “old parser”. At the time of publishing, the “new parser” (the PEG parser) is experimental and unﬁnished. For releases of CPython up to and including 3.8, the pgen parser is the default. For releases of CPython 3.9 and above, the PEG parser is the default. The old parser can be enabled with  -X oldparser  on the command line. The Tokens ﬁle is used by both parsers. The Grammar ﬁle is written in a context-notation called  Backus-Naur Form (BNF) . BNF is not speciﬁc to Python and is often used as the notation for grammar in many other languages. The concept of grammatical structure in a programming language is inspired by  Noam Chomsky’s work on Syntactic Structures  in the 1950s! Python’s grammar ﬁle uses the Extended-BNF (EBNF) speciﬁcation with regular-expression syntax. So, in the grammar ﬁle you can use: •  *  for repetition •  +  for at-least-once repetition •  []  for optional parts •  |  for alternatives •  ()  for grouping As an example, think about how you would deﬁne a cup of coﬀee: • It must have a cup • It must include at least one shot of espresso and can contain multiple 66
