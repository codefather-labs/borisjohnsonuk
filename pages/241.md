Multi-Process Parallelism interpreter is terminated: exitcode  =  _main(fd, parent_sentinel) sys.exit(exitcode) The  _main()  function is called with the ﬁle descriptor of the parent processes pipe and the parent sentinel for checking if the parent process has exited whilst executing the child. The main function deserialises the binary data on the  fd  byte stream. Remember, this is the  pipe  ﬁle handle. The deserialization happens using using same  pickle  library that the parent process used: Parent Process Worker Pool Worker 0 Worker 1 Pipe 010101010100011100 (Initializing) (Not Created) read() Preparation Data Process Object pickle (Waiting) The ﬁrst value is a  dict  containing the preparation data. The second value is an instance of  SpawnProcess  which is then used at the instance to call  _bootstrap()  upon: def  _main(fd, parent_sentinel): with  os.fdopen(fd,  'rb' , closefd = True )  as  from_parent: process.current_process()._inheriting  =  True try : preparation_data  =  reduction.pickle.load(from_parent) prepare(preparation_data) self  =  reduction.pickle.load(from_parent) 241
