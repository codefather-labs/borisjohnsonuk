The PyArena Memory Arena $ ./configure --with-undefined-behavior-sanitizer ... Undeﬁned Behavior Sanitizer is supported on: • Linux • macOS • NetBSD • FreeBSD See the oﬃcial documentation for more information . The Undeﬁned Behavior Sanitizer has many conﬁgurations, using --with-undefined-behavior-sanitizer  will set the  undefined  proﬁle. To use another proﬁle, e.g.,  nullability , run  ./configure  with the custom CFLAGS: $ ./configure CFLAGS="-fsanitize=nullability" LDFLAGS="-fsanitize=nullability" 
#The PyArena Memory Arena 

 Throughout this book, you will see references to a  PyArena  object. The  PyArena  is a separate arena allocation API used for the compiler, frame evaluation, and other parts of the system not run from Python’s Object allocation API. The PyArena also has its own list of allocated objects within the arena structure. Memory allocated by the  PyArena  is not a target of the garbage collector. When memory is allocated in a  PyArena  instance, it will capture a running total of the number of blocks allocated, then call  PyMem_Alloc . Allocation requests to the  PyArena  use the Object Allocator for blocks <= 512KB, or the Raw Allocator for blocks > 256KB.
