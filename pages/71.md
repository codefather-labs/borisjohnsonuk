Regenerating Grammar pass Change that line to accept the terminal (keyword)  'pass'  or  'proceed' as keywords by adding a choice,  | , and the  proceed  literal: pass_stmt: 'pass' | 'proceed' pass proceed Next, rebuild the grammar ﬁles by running  pgen . CPython comes with scripts to automate  pgen . On macOS and Linux, run the  make regen-grammar  target: $ make regen-grammar For Windows, bring up a command line from the  PCBuild  directory and run  build.bat  with the  --regen  flag: > build.bat --regen You should see an output showing that the new  Include graminit.h  and Python graminit.c  ﬁles have been regenerated. With the regenerated parser tables, when you recompile CPython, it will use the new syntax. Use the same compilation steps you used in the last chapter for your operating system. If the code compiled successfully, you can execute your new CPython binary and start a REPL. 71
