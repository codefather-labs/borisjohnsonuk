Benchmarking, Pro�ling, and Tracing When making changes to CPython, you need to verify that your changes do not have a signiﬁcant detrimental impact on performance. You may want to make changes to CPython that improve performance. There are solutions for proﬁling that you will cover in this chapter: 1. Using the  timeit  module to check a simple Python statement thousands of times for the median execution speed 2. Running the Python Benchmark suite to compare multiple versions of Python 3. Using  cProfile  to analyze execution times of frames 4. Proﬁling the CPython execution with probes The choice of solution depends on the type of task: • A  benchmark  will produce an average/median runtime of a ﬁxed code snippet so that you can compare multiple versions of Python runtime • A  pro�ler  will produce a call graph, with execution times so that you can understand which function is the slowest 353
