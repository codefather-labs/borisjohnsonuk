Why CPython Is Written in C and Not Python See Also If you want to learn more about parsers, check out the  lark project. Lark is a parser for context-free grammar written in Python. An excellent example of compiler bootstrapping is the Go programming language. The ﬁrst Go compiler was written in C, then once Go could be compiled, the compiler was rewritten in Go. CPython kept its C heritage; many of the standard library modules, like the  ssl  module or the  sockets  module, are written in C to access low-level operating system APIs. The APIs in the Windows and Linux kernels for  creating network sockets ,  working with the ﬁlesystem , or interacting with the display  are all written in C. It made sense for Python’s extensibility layer to be focused on the C language. Later in this book, you will cover the Python Standard Library and the C modules. There is a Python compiler written in Python called  PyPy . PyPy’s logo is an  Ouroboros  to represent the self-hosting nature of the compiler. Another example of a cross-compiler for Python is  Jython . Jython is written in Java and compiles from Python source code into Java bytecode. In the same way that CPython makes it easy to import C libraries and use them from Python, Jython makes it easy to import and reference Java modules and classes. The ﬁrst step of creating a compiler is to deﬁne the language. For example, this is not valid Python: def  my_example()  < str >  : { void *  result  = ; } The compiler needs strict rules of the grammatical structure for the language before it tries to execute it. 63
