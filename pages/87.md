Building a Module From Input the root folder. This ﬁle is created dynamically in the  ./configure  step in the build process for macOS/Linux, or by  build.bat  in Windows. You can see the build conﬁguration by running: $ ./python -m sysconfig Platform: "macosx-10.15-x86_64" Python version: "3.9" Current installation scheme: "posix_prefix" Paths: data = "/usr/local" include = "/Users/anthonyshaw/CLionProjects/cpython/Include" platinclude = "/Users/anthonyshaw/CLionProjects/cpython" ... Build conﬁguration properties are compile-time values used to select additional modules to be linked into the binary. For example, debuggers, instrumentation libraries, and memory allocators are all set at compile time. With the three conﬁguration stages, the CPython interpreter can now take input and process text into executable code. 
#Building a Module From Input 

 Before any code can be executed, it must be compiled into a module from an input. As discussed before, inputs can vary in type: • Local ﬁles and packages • I/O Streams, e.g., stdin or a memory pipe • Strings Inputs are read and then passed to the parser, and then the compiler. 87
