Basic C Syntax switch  (WaitForSingleObjectEx(handle,  0 , FALSE)) { case  WAIT_OBJECT_0: if  (!ReleaseSemaphore(handle,  1 , &previous)) return  MP_STANDARD_ERROR; *value = previous +  1 ; return  0 ; case  WAIT_TIMEOUT: *value =  0 ; return  0 ; default : return  MP_STANDARD_ERROR; } This performs a switch on the return value from  WaitForSingleObjectEx() . If the value is  WAIT_OBJECT_0 , the ﬁrst block is executed. The  WAIT_- TIMEOUT  value results in the second block, and anything else matches the  default  block. Note that the value being tested, in this case the return value from WaitForSingleObjectEx() , must be an integral value or an enumerated type and that each  case  must be a constant value. 
##Loops 

 There are three looping structures in C: •  for  loops •  while  loops •  do..while  loops Let’s look at each of these in turn. for  loops have syntax that is quite diﬀerent than Python: for  ( <initialization>; <condition>; <increment>) { <code to be looped over> } 384
