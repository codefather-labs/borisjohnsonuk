You will ﬁrst need the essential C compiler toolkit. “Command Line Development Tools” is an app that you can update in macOS through the App Store.

You will also need a working copy of  OpenSSL  to use for fetching packages from the PyPi.org website. If you later plan on using this build to install additional packages, SSL validation is required. The simplest way to install OpenSSL on macOS is by using  Homebrew . Note If you don’t have Homebrew, you can download and install Homebrew directly from GitHub with the following command: $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL \ https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" Once you have Homebrew installed, you can install the dependencies for CPython with the  brew install  command: 44
