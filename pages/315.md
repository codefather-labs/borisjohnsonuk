##Lookups 

 For a given key object, there is a generic lookup function  lookdict() . Dictionary lookups need to cater for three scenarios: 1. The memory address of the key exists in the key table 2. The hash value of the object exists in the key table 3. The key does not exist in the dictionary See Also The lookup function is based on Donald Knuth’s famous book, “The art of Computer Programming”, chapter 6, section 4 on hashing (ISBN 978-0201896855) The sequence of the lookup function is: 315
