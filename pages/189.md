The CPython Memory Allocator • The pymalloc allocator only allocates memory blocks up to 256KB, anything larger is sent to the system allocator • The pymalloc allocator uses the GIL instead of the system threadsafety check To help explain this situation, we’re going to use a physical sports stadium as our analogy. This is the stadium of “CPython FC,” our ﬁctional team. To help manage crowds, CPython FC has implemented a system of breaking the stadium up into sections A-E, each with seating rows 140. The rows at the front of the stadium (1-10) are the Premium seats, each taking up more space. So there can only be 80 seats per row. At the back, from rows 31-40 are the Economy seats. There are 150 seats per row: Section A Section B Section E Section D Section C rows 1-10 rows 11-20 rows 21-30 rows 31-40 • Just like the stadium has seats, the pymalloc algorithm has memory “ blocks ” 189
