Compiling CPython on Linux $ sudo yum-builddep python3 For Debian, Ubuntu, or other  apt -based systems: $ sudo apt install libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev \ libncursesw5-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev libgdbm-dev \ libdb5.3-dev libbz2-dev libexpat1-dev liblzma-dev libffi-dev Now that you have the dependencies, you can run the  configure  script, optionally enabling the debug hooks  --with-pydebug : $ ./configure --with-pydebug Next, you can build the CPython binary by running the generated Makefile : $ make -j2 -s See Also For more help on the options for  make , see section A Quick Primer on Make. Review the output to ensure that there weren’t issues compiling the _ssl  module. If there were, check with your distribution for instructions on installing the headers for OpenSSL. During the build, you may receive some errors. In the build the summary,  make  will notify you that not all packages were built. That’s okay if you aren’t planning on developing against those packages. If you are, then check out the package details for required libraries. The build will take a few minutes and generate a binary called  python . This is the debug binary of CPython.
