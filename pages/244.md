Multi-Process Parallelism There is two types of communication between processes, depending on the nature of the task. Semaphores Many of the mechanisms in multiprocessing use  semaphores  as a way of signaling that resources are locked, being waited on, or not used. Operating Systems use binary semaphores as a simple variable type for locking resources, like ﬁles, sockets, and other resources. If one process is writing to a ﬁle or a network socket, you don’t want another process to suddenly start writing to the same ﬁle. The data would become corrupt instantly. Instead, Operating Systems put a “lock” on resources using a semaphore. Processes can also signal that they are waiting for that lock to be released so that when it is, they get a message to say it is ready and they can start using it. Semaphores (in the real world) are a signaling method using flags, so the states for a resource of waiting, locked and not-used would look like: -1 1 0 waiting locked The semaphore API is diﬀerent between Operating Systems, so there is an abstraction class, multiprocessing.syncronize.Semaphore . 244
