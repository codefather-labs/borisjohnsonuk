Concrete Syntax Tree Generation Compiler Reader Text AST Lexer Parser CST The two parts of the parsing process are: 1. Creating a Concrete Syntax Tree using a  Parser-Tokenizer ( Lexer ) 2. Creating an Abstract Syntax Tree from a Concrete Syntax Tree using a  Parser These two steps are common paradigms used in many programming languages. 
#Concrete Syntax Tree Generation 

 The Concrete Syntax Tree (CST) (or sometimes known as a  parsetree ), is an ordered, rooted tree structure that represents code in a context-free grammar. The CST is created from a  tokenizer  and  parser . You explored the parser-generator in the chapter on  The Python Language and Grammar . The output from the parser-generator is a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) parsing table, describing the possible states of context-free grammar. See Also The original author of Python, Guido van Rossum is currently working on a contextual-grammar as an alternative to LL(1), the grammar used in CPython. The alternative is called Parser Expression Grammar, or PEG. This will be available as an experimental feature in Python 3.9 95
