Multi-Process Parallelism 2. Spawn a thread Now that you have reviewed what makes up a process. Next, you can explore forking and spawning child processes. 
#Multi-Process Parallelism 

 POSIX systems provide an API for any process to  fork  a child process. Forking processes is a low-level API call to the Operating System that can be made by any running process. When this call is made, the OS will clone all the attributes of the currently running process and create a new process. This clone operation includes the heap, register, and counter position of the parent process. The child process can read any variables from the parent process at the time of forking. 
##Forking a Process in POSIX 

 As an example, take the Fahrenheit to Celcius example application used at the beginning of Dynamic Memory Allocation in C. Adapt it to spawn a child process for each Fahrenheit value instead of calculating them in sequence. This is accomplished by using the  fork()  function. Each child process will continue operating from that point: cpython-book-samples 33 thread_celcius.c #include  <stdio.h> #include  <stdlib.h> #include  <unistd.h> static const double  five_ninths =  5.0 / 9.0 ; double  celsius( double  fahrenheit){ 231
