Python and C Modules Py_RETURN_NONE; } The contents of some modules written in C expose operating system functions. Because the CPython source code needs to compile to macOS, Windows, Linux, and other *nix-based operating systems, there are some special cases. The  time  module is a good example. The way that Windows keeps and stores time in the Operating System is fundamentally diﬀerent than Linux and macOS. This is one of the reasons why the accuracy of the clock functions diﬀers  between Operating Systems . In  Modules timemodule.c , the Operating System time functions for Unix-based systems are imported from  <sys/times.h> : #ifdef HAVE_SYS_TIMES_H #include  <sys/times.h> #endif ... #ifdef MS_WINDOWS #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN #include  <windows.h> #include  "pythread.h" #endif /* MS_WINDOWS */ ... Later in the ﬁle,  time_process_time_ns()  is deﬁned as a wrapper for  _- PyTime_GetProcessTimeWithInfo() : static  PyObject * time_process_time_ns(PyObject *self, PyObject *unused) { _PyTime_t t; if  (_PyTime_GetProcessTimeWithInfo(&t, NULL) <  0 ) { return  NULL; } return  _PyTime_AsNanosecondsObject(t); } 322
