The Test Suite CPython has a robust and extensive test suite covering the core interpreter, the standard library, the tooling, and distribution for Windows, Linux, and macOS. The test suite is located in  Lib test  and written almost entirely in Python. The full test suite is a Python package, so it can be run using the Python interpreter that you’ve compiled. 
#Running the Test Suite on Windows 

 On Windows use the  rt.bat  script inside the  PCBuild  folder. For example, to run the “quick” mode against the Debug conﬁguration on an x64 architecture: > cd PCbuild > rt.bat -q -d -x64 == CPython 3.9.0b1 == Windows-10-10.0.17134-SP0 little-endian == cwd: C:\repos\cpython\build\test_python_2784 == CPU count: 2 == encodings: locale=cp1252, FS=utf-8 Run tests sequentially 0:00:00 [ 1/420] test_grammar 324
