Multi-Process Parallelism So you can compare the diï¬€erence, it will print the execution time at the end: cpython-book-samples 33 portscanner.py from  queue  import  Queue import  socket import  time timeout  =  1.0 def  check_port(host: str, port: int, results: Queue): sock  =  socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM) sock.settimeout(timeout) result  =  sock.connect_ex((host, port)) if  result  ==  0 : results.put(port) sock.close() if  __name__  ==  '__main__' : start  =  time.time() host  =  "localhost" # replace with a host you own results  =  Queue() for  port  in  range( 80 ,  100 ): check_port(host, port, results) while not  results.empty(): print( "Port  {0}  is open" .format(results.get())) print( "Completed scan in  {0}  seconds" .format(time.time()  -  start)) The execution will print out the open ports and the time taken: $ python portscanner.py Port 80 is open Completed scan in 19.623435020446777 seconds This example can be refactored to use multiprocessing. The  Queue  interface is swapped for  multiprocessing.Queue  and the ports are scanned together using a pool executor: cpython-book-samples 33 portscanner_mp_queue.py 253
