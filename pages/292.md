 In Python, objects have a property  ob_type , you can get the value of this property using the builtin function  type() : >>>  t  =  type( "hello" ) >>>  t < class  'str' > The result from  type()  is an instance of a  PyTypeObject : >>>  type(t) < class  'type' > Type objects are used to deﬁne the implementation of abstract base classes. For example, objects alway have the  __repr__()  method implemented: >>>  class  example: ... x  =  1 >>>  i  =  example() >>>  repr(i) '<__main__.example object at 0x10b418100>' The implementation of the  __repr__()  method is always at the same address in the type deﬁnition of any object. This position is known as a  type slot . 
##Type Slots 

 All of the type slots are deﬁned in  Include cpython object.h . Each type slot has a property name and a function signature. The  _- _repr__()  function for example is called  tp_repr  and has a signature reprfunc : 292
