Unicode String Type Both XML and HTML support unicode code points with a special escape character  &#val; , where  val  is the decimal value of the code point. If you need to encode Unicode code points into XML or HTML, you can use the  xmlcharrefreplace  error-handler in the  .encode()  method: >>>  "u0107" .encode( 'ascii' ,  'xmlcharrefreplace' ) b '&#263;' The output will contain HTML/XML-escaped code-points. All modern browsers will decode this escape sequence into the correct character. ASCII Compatibility If you are working with ASCII-encoded text, it is important to understand the diﬀerence between UTF7/8 and UTF16. UTF8 has a major beneﬁt of being compatible with ASCII encoded text. ASCII encoding is a 7-bit encoding. The ﬁrst 128 code points on the Unicode Standard represent the existing 128 characters of the ASCII standard. For example, the Latin letter  'a'  is the 97th character in ASCII and the 97th character in Unicode. Decimal 97 is equivalent to 61 in hexadecimal, so the Unicode code point is  U+0061 . On the REPL, if you create the binary code for the letter  'a' : >>>  letter_a  =  b 'a' >>>  letter_a.decode( 'utf8' ) 'a' This can correctly be decoded into UTF8. UTF16 works with 2-4 byte code points. The 1-byte representation of the letter  'a'  will not decode: >>>  letter_a.decode( 'utf16' ) Traceback (most recent call last): File  "<stdin>" , line  1 ,  in  < module > 304
