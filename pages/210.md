Reference Counting } else  { _Py_Dealloc(op); } } Inside  Py_DECREF() , when the reference counter ( ob_refcnt ) value becomes 0, the object destructor is called via  _Py_Dealloc(op) , and any allocated memory is freed. As with Py_INCREF() , there are some additional functions when CPython has been compiled in debug mode. For an increment, there should be an equivalent decrement operation. If a reference count becomes a negative number, this indicates an imbalance in the C code. An attempt to decrement references to an object that has no references will give this error message: <file>:<line>: _Py_NegativeRefcount: Assertion failed: object has negative ref count Enable tracemalloc to get the memory block allocation traceback object address : 0x109eaac50 object refcount : -1 object type : 0x109cadf60 object type name: <type> object repr : <refcnt -1 at 0x109eaac50> When making changes to the behavior of an operation, the Python language, or the compiler, you must carefully consider the impact on object references. 
##Reference Counting in Bytecode Operations 

 A large portion of the reference counting in the Python happens within the bytecode operations in  Python ceval.c . Take this example, how many references do you think there are to  y ? 210
