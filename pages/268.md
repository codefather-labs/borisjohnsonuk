Asynchronous Programming Lastly, the thread handle,  pthread_t  is cast into an  unsigned long  and returned to become the thread ID. 
##Windows Threads 

 Windows threads implemented in  Python thread_nt.h  follow a similar, but simpler pattern. The stack size of the new thread is conﬁgured to the interpreter pythread_stacksize  value (if set). The thread is created using the  _beginthreadex()  Windows API  using the bootstrap function as the callback. Lastly, the thread ID is returned. 
##Conclusion 

 This was not an exhaustive tutorial on Python threads. Python’s thread implementation is extensive and oﬀers many mechanisms for sharing data between threads, locking objects, and resources. Threads are a great, eﬃcient way of improving the runtime of your Python applications when they are IO-bound. In this section, you have seen what the GIL is, why it exists and which parts of the standard library may be exempt from its constraints. 
#Asynchronous Programming 

 Python oﬀers many ways of accomplishing concurrent programming without using threads or multiprocessing. These features have been added, expanded, and often replaced with better alternatives. For the target version of this book, 3.9.0b1, the following asynchronous systems are deprecated: • The  @coroutine  decorator 268
