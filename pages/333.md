Using Lldb for macOS 
##Windows 

 Following the same steps as you did in the chapter on Compiling CPython (Windows), ensure that you have compiled in the  Debug conﬁguration to get the debug symbols: > build.bat -p x64 -c Debug Remember, the Debug conﬁguration produces the executable  python_- d.exe , so make sure you use this executable for debugging. 
##macOS/Linux 

 The steps in the chapter on Compiling CPython, specify to run the ./configure  script with the  --with-pydebug  flag. If you did not include this flag, go back now and run  ./configure  again with your original options and the  --with-pydebug  flag. This will produce the correct executable and symbols for debugging. 
#Using Lldb for macOS 

 The  lldb  debugger comes with the Xcode developer tools, so by now you, will have it installed. Start lldb and load the CPython compiled binary as the target: $ lldb ./python.exe (lldb) target create "./python.exe" Current executable set to './python.exe' (x86_64). You will now have a prompt where you can enter some commands for debugging. 
##Creating Breakpoints 

 To create a breakpoint, use the  break set  command, with the ﬁle (relative to the root) and the line number: 333
