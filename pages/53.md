Compiling CPython on Windows Open up a command-line prompt inside  PCBuild  and execute  PCBuild get_externals.bat : > get_externals.bat Using py -3.7 (found 3.7 with py.exe) Fetching external libraries... Fetching bzip2-1.0.6... Fetching sqlite-3.28.0.0... Fetching xz-5.2.2... Fetching zlib-1.2.11... Fetching external binaries... Fetching openssl-bin-1.1.1d... Fetching tcltk-8.6.9.0... Finished. Now you can compile from the command line or Visual Studio. 
##Compiling From the Command Line 

 To compile from the command line, you need to select the CPU architecture you want to compile against. The default is win32, but the chances are you want a 64-bit ( amd64 ) binary. If you do any debugging, the debug build comes with the ability to attach breakpoints in the source code. To enable the debug build, you add  -c Debug  to specify the Debug conﬁguration. By default,  build.bat  will fetch external dependencies, but because we’ve already done that step, it will print a message skipping downloads: > build.bat -p x64 -c Debug This command will produce the Python binary  PCbuild amd64 python_- d.exe . Start that binary directly from the command line: > amd64\python_d.exe Python 3.9.0b1 (tags/v3.9.0b1:97fe9cf, May 19 2020, 10:00:00) 53
