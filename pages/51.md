The  `Future`  class represents a  *state*  of something that is interacting with a loop. That description is too fuzzy to be useful, so you can instead think of a  `Future`  instance as a toggle for completion status. When a  `Future`  instance is created, the toggle is set to “not yet completed,” but at some later time it will be “completed.” In fact, a  `Future` instance has a method called  `done()`  that allows you to check the status, as shown in Example 3-15 . *Example 3-15. Checking completion status with done()* `>>>` ` ` `from` ` ` `asyncio` ` ` `import` ` ` `Future` `>>>` ` ` `f` ` ` `=` ` ` `Future` `()` `>>>` ` ` `f` `.` `done` `()` `False` A  `Future`  instance may also do the following: •  Have a “result” value set (use  `.set_result(` `value` `)`  to set it and  `.result()`  to obtain it) •  Be cancelled with  `.cancel()`  (and check for cancellation with  `.cancelled()` ) •  Have additional callback functions added that will be run when the future completes Even though  `Task` s are more common, you can’t avoid  `Future` s entirely: for instance, running a function on an executor will return a  `Future`  instance,  *not*  a  `Task` . Let’s take a quick look at  Example 3-16  to get a feel for what it is like to work with a  `Future` instance directly. *Example 3-16.
