CPython’s Make Targets 
##Cleaning Targets 

 The primary clean targets are  clean ,  clobber  and  distclean . The  clean target is for generally removing compiled and cached libraries and pyc ﬁles. If you ﬁnd that  clean  doesn’t do the job, try  clobber . For completely cleaning out an environment before distribution, run the distclean  target. Target Purpose check-clean-src Check that the source is clean when building out of source cleantest Remove ”test_python_*” directories of previous failed test jobs clean Remove pyc ﬁles, compiled libraries and proﬁles pycremoval Remove pyc ﬁles docclean Remove built documentation in Doc/ profile-removal Remove any optimization proﬁles clobber Same as  clean , but also removes libraries, tags, conﬁgurations and builds distclean Same as  clobber , but also removes anything generated from source, e.g. Makeﬁle 
##Installation Targets 

 There are two flavors for the installation targets, the default version, e.g.  install  and the  alt  version, e.g.  altinstall . If you want to install the compiled version onto your computer, but don’t want it to become the default Python 3 installation, use the  alt  version of the commands. After installing using  make install , the command  python3  will now link to your compiled binary. Whereas, using  make altinstall , only  python$(VERSION)  will be installed and the existing link for  python3  will remain intact. Target Purpose install Installs shared libraries, binaries and documentation. Will run  commoninstall ,  bininstall  and  maninstall bininstall Installs all the binaries, e.g.  python ,  idle ,  2to3 altinstall Installs shared libraries, binaries and documentation with the version suﬃx 51
