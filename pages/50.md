#CPython’s Make Targets 

 For both Linux and macOS, you will ﬁnd yourself needing to clean up ﬁles, build, or to refresh conﬁguration. There are a number of useful make targets built into CPython’s Makeﬁle: 
##Build Targets 

 Target Purpose all  (default) Build the compiler, libraries and modules profile-opt Compile the Python binary with proﬁle guided optimization clinic Run “Argument Clinic” over all source ﬁles) sharedmods Build the shared modules regen-all Regenerate all generated ﬁles 
##Test Targets 

 Target Purpose test Run a basic set of regression tests testall Run the full test suite twice - once without .pyc ﬁles, and once with quicktest Run a faster set of regression tests, excluding the tests that take a long time testuniversal Run the test suite for both architectures in a Universal build on OSX coverage Compile and run tests with gcov coverage-lcov Create coverage HTML reports 50
