#Conclusion 

 The Python regression test suite is full of two decades of tests for strange edge cases, bug ﬁxes, and new features. Outside of this, there is still a large part of the CPython standard library that has little or no testing. If you want to get involved in the CPython project, writing or extending unit tests is a great place to start. If you’re going to modify any part of CPython or add additional functionality, you will need to have written, or extended tests as part of your patch. Leave feedback on this section » 330
