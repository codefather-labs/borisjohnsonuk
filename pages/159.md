##Frame Object Initialization API 

 The API for Frame Object Initialization,  PyEval_EvalCode()  is the entry point for evaluating a code object PyEval_EvalCode()  is a wrapper around the internal function  _PyEval_- EvalCode() . Note _PyEval_EvalCode()  is a complex function that deﬁnes many behaviours of both frame objects and the interpreter loop. It is an important function to understand as it can also teach you some principles of the CPython interpreter design. In this section you will step through the logic in  _PyEval_EvalCode() . The  _PyEval_EvalCode()  function speciﬁes many arguments: •  tstate :  a  PyThreadState *  pointing to the thread state of the thread this code will be evaluated on 159
