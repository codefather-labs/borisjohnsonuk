Reference Counting Note You can see the global reference counter by adding the  -X showrefcount  flag when running CPython: $ ./python -X showrefcount -c "x=1; x+=1; print(f'x is {x}')" x is 2 [18497 refs, 6470 blocks] The ﬁrst number in brackets is the number of references made during the process, and the second is the number of allocated blocks. 
##Decrementing References 

 References to an object are decremented when a variable falls outside of the scope in which it was declared. Scope in Python can refer to a function or method, a comprehension, or a lambda. These are some of the more literal scopes, but there are many other implicit scopes, like passing variables to a function call. The  Py_DECREF()  function is more complex than  Py_INCREF()  because it also handles the logic of a reference count reaching 0, requiring the object memory to be freed: static  inline  void  _Py_DECREF( #ifdef Py_REF_DEBUG const char  *filename,  int  lineno, #endif PyObject *op) { _Py_DEC_REFTOTAL; if  (--op->ob_refcnt !=  0 ) { #ifdef Py_REF_DEBUG if  (op->ob_refcnt <  0 ) { _Py_NegativeRefcount(filename, lineno, op); } #endif 209
