Reference Counting pointer would point to invalid memory space, and CPython would crash. Throughout the C source code for CPython, you will see calls to  Py_- INCREF()  and  Py_DECREF() . These macros are the primary API for incrementing and decrementing references to Python objects. Whenever something depends on a value, the reference count increases, when that dependency is no longer valid, the reference count decreases. If a reference count reaches zero, it is assumed that it is no longer needed, and it is automatically freed. 
##Incrementing References 

 Every instance of  PyObject  has a property  ob_refcnt . This property is a counter of the number of references to that object. References to an object are incremented under many scenarios. In the CPython code base, there are over 3000 calls to  Py_INCREF() . The most frequent calls are when an object is: • assigned to a variable name • referenced as a function or method argument • returned, or yielded from a function The logic behind the  Py_INCREF  macro is simple. It increments the  ob_- refcnt  value by 1: static  inline  void  _Py_INCREF(PyObject *op) { _Py_INC_REFTOTAL; op->ob_refcnt++; } If CPython is compiled in debug mode,  _Py_INC_REFTOTAL  will increment a global reference counter,  _Py_RefTotal . 208
