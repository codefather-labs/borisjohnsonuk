Garbage Collection 
##Garbage Collection Algorithm 

 See Also The CPython core development team has written a  detailed guide  on the GC algorithm. Initialization The  PyGC_Collect()  entry-point follows ﬁve steps to start, and stop the garbage collector. 1. Get the Garbage Collection state,  GCState  from the interpreter 2. Check to see if the GC is enabled 3. Check to see if the GC is already running 4. Run the collection function,  collect()  with progress callbacks 5. Mark the GC as completed When the collection stage is run and completed, callback methods can be user-speciﬁed by the  gc.callbacks  list. Callbacks should have a method signature  f(stage: str, info: dict) : Python  3 . 9.0 b1 (tags / v3. 9.0 b1:97fe9cf, May  19 2020 ,  10 : 00 : 00 ) [Clang  6.0  (clang -600 . 0.57 )] on darwin Type  "help" ,  "copyright" ,  "credits"  or  "license"  for  more information. >>>  import  gc >>>  def  gc_callback(phase, info): ... print( f"GC phase: { phase }  with info: { info } " ) ... >>>  gc.callbacks.append(gc_callback) >>>  x  =  [] >>>  x.append(x) >>>  del  x >>>  gc.collect() GC phase:start  with  info:{ 'generation' :  2 ,  'collected' :  0 ,  'uncollectable' :  0 } GC phase:stop  with  info:{ 'generation' :  2 ,  'collected' :  1 ,  'uncollectable' :  0 } 1 218
